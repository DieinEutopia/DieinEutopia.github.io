<p>Article 40 of the constitution of India says :“The state shall take steps to organize village Panchayats and endow them with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as units of self-government.” Though, in ultimate analysis, self-governance in a bourgeois set-up serves the interest of the oppressor ruling class, yet, for long, there was no pressure from below upon them to put into effect even this modest and limited declaration of the constitution. Congress as the oldest organized party of the bureaucratic big bourgeoisie and feudal lords was at the centre of national and local level politics. Big jotedars in the rural areas were the vehicle of Congress-rule.</p>
<p>印度宪法的第四十条说道：“国家应采取步骤组织乡村评议会，并赋以必要之权力与权威，使之具有自治单位之职能。”尽管如此，从本质上来看，资产阶级的建制中的所谓“自治”，也仅仅是为了迎合身为压迫者的统治阶级的利益而服务的。然而，很久以来，从来没有这样一股来自下面或者上面的压力迫使他们将这个言辞温和而又有着局限性的宪法宣言实现哪怕一点。国大党，这个印度历史上最古老的由官僚垄断资产阶级和封建领主阶级所把持的政党，就是制定这些国家政策乃至地方政策的核心。大乔特达尔（殖民地时期是封建主之下的二地主或富农，在尼赫鲁废除柴明达尔制度后后成为印度农村地主阶级中新兴的一个阶层——译者注）就是替国大党在农村地区进行统治的代理人。</p>
<p>This was the period of individual authority of big jotedars in rural life. Panchayats were a de-facto non-entity. For obvious reasons, any anti-feudal peasant struggle during those days used to take a leap towards an anti-Congress struggle in no time. In our State, Gandhi-cap-clad Congressite Seva Dal much exceeded police forces, so far as the atrocity against the struggling peasants of Tebagha movement is concerned. In fact, this Seva Dal was a gang of goons of the then jotedars. From 1964 general election people throughout the country started challenging the one party autocratic domination of Congress. With it was juxtaposed the aspiration of the regional bureaucratic bourgeoisie of different nationalities. The one and half decade between mid-sixties to end-seventies was a positive turbulent period in Paschim Banga politics, much alike that in contemporary world politics. At one end, people took on the path of Dumdum Dawai against the ruling class-made artificial food crisis and famines throughout the country and on the other end, the heroic struggle of the Naxalite revolutionaries for the seizure of political power, erupted like prairie fire throughout the country.</p>
<p>曾经有那么一段时间，乔特达尔在农村生活中有着极大的个人权威，这让村务委员会实际上形同虚设。正因为如此，显而易见，在那段日子里，任何旨在反抗封建制度的农民斗争都常常会上升为旨在推翻国大党统治的斗争。在我国，打着甘地招牌的的国大党基层组织Seva Dal在镇压特伦甘纳起义时所犯下的罪行罄竹难书，甚至远远超过了身为政府鹰犬的警察。事实上，Seva Dal就是由这些曾经的乔特达尔，这样的一伙暴徒组成的匪帮。自从1964年大选以来，全国各地的人民都开始向国大党的一党独裁的统治发起了挑战。与之并列，同样受到挑战的是各地方上各民族的官僚资产阶级。在六十年代中期和七十年代末期的十五年之间，和当时的全世界各国普遍的政治表现一样， 西孟加拉也同样经历了这样一个富有希望而动荡不安的时期。在一端，是全国人民沿着“达姆达姆药”运动（“达姆达姆药”运动（Dum Dum dawai），是一起1962年粮荒期间，在西孟加拉邦达姆达姆地区，人们攻击囤积粮食的商人，并扩散至其他地区的大规模运动——译者注）的道路前进并和由统治阶级所人为制造的粮食危机和饥荒自发的斗争；在另一端，则是纳萨尔派革命者旨在武装夺取政权的英勇斗争，如同爆发的燎原之火般席卷了全国各地。</p>
<p>Militant revolutionary anti feudal struggle of the Naxalites started finding place even in academic text books. Despite correct revolutionary orientation, the revolution had to face set back because of the failure of the CPI (ML) to resolve the problem of the military line correctly. The void was filled by the so called main-stream political parties through their parallel reactionary-revisionist practice. The so called left front came to power in Paschim Banga in much the same way. Taking lessons from the experience of the topsy-turvy past, the ruling class adopted new tactics – one aspect of it was to indulge in bargaining and reconciling with their regional counterparts and another was to reorganize the institutions of the self-governance at grass-root levels and to confer on them more power than before. The goal of the first tactics was to keep the happy family of the ruling class intact. The aim of the second tactics was to keep people deliberately away from the dream of the revolutionary transformation and to consolidate the yoke of the oppressor class rule at the root level. Immediately after assuming power in 1977, the left front took active measures for regularizing panchayat-municipal and corporation polls.</p>
<p>纳萨尔派反对封建制度的激进革命甚至开始在学术课本上都有了一席之地。然而，尽管有着正确的革命方向，这场革命还是因为印度共产党（马列）无法正确地解决其军事路线的问题而遭遇了挫折。而这一问题所遗留下的空白随后就被所谓的“主流政党”的反动主义-修正主义路线所填充。这个所谓的“左翼阵线”在西孟加拉邦得以掌权之后，不过是表现的和它的前任一模一样。从先前的一败涂地中学了不少的统治阶级采取了新的策略——一方面放纵它的地方上的同行，与之讨价还价，寻求妥协；另一方面则是重组它的地方自治机构以及基层组织，并授予它们比先前更大的权力。很明显，第一个策略的目的是企图维持统治阶级的完整性，构建一个“和和睦睦的大家庭”；第二个策略的目的则是妄图阻止人民向革命转变，巩固压迫阶级在基层层次对人民的束缚。在1977年掌权之后不久，“左翼阵线”就采取了积极地措施来调整村委会、居委会和市镇地方选举的制度。</p>
<p>They went for the reorganization of the three tier panchayat system. A big chunk of Congressite jotedars became CPM-mentors overnight. CPM ousted the remaining hard-core section from power and started concentrating the same in the hands of the socially influential party leaders. In the pre-left front period, big jotedars used to carry on their political rule directly. The economic and political reins were in their hands. During CPM-regime there was an apparent separation between economic and political power centers. In the new phase party and panchayat duo became the tool of exercising political power. A neo-jotedar class started concentrating all powers of party and panchayats in their hands.</p>
<p>他们对整个村务委员会体系做出了三个层次的重组。一大批国大党走狗乔特达尔在一夜之间俨然成了印度共产党（马克思主义）的真正导师。在那些拥有社会影响力的“党的领袖”的操纵下，印共马将它仅存的革命核心驱逐出党。在左翼阵线执政之前的时期，乔特卡尔过去常常直接实行他们的政治统治。他们紧握着政治上和经济上的束缚人民的缰绳。而在印共马政权时期，政治和经济的权力中心之间出现了表面上的分离。在这个新阶段，印共马的党和村务委员会这二者都变成了行使政权的工具。一个新的乔特达尔阶级开始通过党和村务委员会将一切权力集中在他们自己手上。</p>
<p>On the other hand these party bosses became local neo-jotedar class. They had woven under the garb of party a new cobweb of class rule at all levels of rural life. Because of state-backing they became like the fascist Gestapo in no time. The unwritten verdict was׃ staying in the village and disobeying CPM is like a foolish person fighting against crocodiles while staying in a river. From 1977 to 2006, this was how the State was moving. A sterile status quo of the burning Ghats. CPM’s homeopathic relief scheme was going perfectly hand in hand with the ruling class schemata of consolidation of power at grass root level. The situation took a u-turn because of Singur-Nandigram-Lalgarh.</p>
<p>换句话说，就是这些党的头头们变成了当地的新乔特达尔阶级。他们已经在党的外皮下编织了覆盖了农村生活中方方面面的行使着阶级统治功能的网络。随着形势的转变，他们很快就堕落得与法西斯盖世太保无异。不成文的事实是：想在农村和印共马作对就像一个蠢蛋想在河水里面打败一群鳄鱼。这就是这个邦从1977年到2006年所经历的转变，如同河边火葬场一样贫瘠的现状。印共马顺水推舟的投降计划在和统治阶级的携手媾和中进行的相当顺利，完美地秉承统治阶级的意旨完成了它们对基层政权的整合。然而，这种情况在辛古尔-楠迪格拉姆-拉噶拉系列事件中迎来了巨大转变。</p>
<p>As the revolutionaries failed to raise these struggles to a higher stage along the revolutionary line, Paschim Banga people ventilated their long-suppressed grievances through Panchayat, Loksabha and Assembly polls.All three elections became a kind of referendum on the land acquisition issue. Left front was ousted and people’s wrath against them brought TMC-combine to power. The new government has been in power for five months since then. Nothing has, however, changed. Except the slogans. This government has also taken the same CPM-path, which means ruling the rural people from party offices. It moves along the path of murders-infighting-suppression of opponents and autocracy. The old CPM party’s mega structure is to a large extent dismantled and the wing of TMC is very quickly taking its place. The major part of the CPM-led neo-jotedars is changing side overnight. Just like Congressite jotedars joining CPM camp three and half decade back. This is what we call the comic repetition of HISTORY.</p>
<p>当这些曾经的“革命者”无法沿着革命路线将他们的斗争上升到一个全新的阶段时，西孟加拉邦人民将他们因长期因压迫而积蓄的怒火宣泄到了印共马的村务委员会，印度人民院（议会下院，印度的主要立法机构——译者注），和西孟加拉邦立法会的头上。这三个选举的结果成为了一种关于土地征用问题的全民意义上的公投。“左翼阵线”被愤懑的人民赶下了台，这让草根国大党领导的西孟加拉邦联合政府得以上位。从那时起，新政府已经执政五个月了。但是，一·切·都·不·曾·改·变。除了口号以外，这个政府还是沿着印共马的老路“前进”，即继续通过各级党委来统治农村地区的人民。也就是说，它还是沿着一条对政敌进行谋杀-内斗-镇压的道路“前进”，并继续着独裁统治。印共马党内陈旧而庞杂的结构被极大地拆毁了，而草根国大党的爪牙也迅速地取而代之。处在印共马党内统治地位的大部分新乔特达尔在一夜之间毫不犹豫地倒戈了。就好像他们原本就是国大党的乔特达尔，只是在印共马度了三十五年的假就回来了似的。这就是我们所谓历史的戏剧性重演。</p>

This class has been created during the post-seventies period to serve the imperialist interest of penetrating deeper into the rural areas of a semi-feudal, semi-colonial country like India. The revolutionaries must have crystal clarity regarding how the neo-jotedar class is working as a tool of the penetration of imperialism and bureaucratic capital in our agriculture. Equally imperative is to understand the direction of change in the rural political power-structure. The nature of capitalism in a semi-feudal, semi-colonial country like ours is comprador as well as bureaucratic. It is comprador because it serves the interest of imperialism and develops under its tutelage.</p>
<p>新乔特达尔阶级不是从天上掉下来的。这个阶级是在过去七十年为了迎合帝国主义在印度这样一个半殖民地半封建国家的农村地区更深地扎根的利益而被创造出来的。革命者必须要极其清晰地认识到新乔特达尔阶级是如何作为帝国主义和官僚资本渗透我国农业的工具而存在。这也同样要求革命者认识清楚农村的政治权力结构的变化方向。在我们的这样一个半殖民地半封建国家里，资本主义的性质表现为买办资本主义和官僚资本主义。之所以叫做买办资本主义，是因为它为帝国主义的利益服务，并且仰其鼻息，受其控制。</p>
<p>It is bureaucratic because it survives and develops on the basis of semi-colonial state patronage. This capitalism is not confined only within industrial and service sector. It is not big bourgeoisie like Tata-Birla-Ambanis alone who are comprador-bureaucratic capitalists. With imperialist backing this capitalism has penetrated into agriculture as well. The characteristics of this bureaucratic capitalism, developed in agricultural sector, are:</p>
<p>之所以叫做官僚资本主义，是因为它的存在和发展建立在半殖民地国家的庇护下。这种资本主义并不仅限存在于工业和服务业部门。它不是像塔塔财团、博拉家族、安巴尼兄弟这样的买办官僚大资产阶级。在帝国主义的支持下，这种资本主义也同样渗透了农业。官僚资本主义在农业部门发展而出的特征如下：</p>
<p>(1) imperialism has created this capitalism to serve its own interest;</p>
<p>(1) 帝国主义创造它的目的是为自己的利益而服务；</p>
<p>(2) this capitalism has developed on the base of feudalism;</p>
<p>(2) 这种资本主义建立在封建制度的基础之上；</p>
<p>(3) it has developed on the basis of direct state patronage. Bureaucratic capitalism started developing in rural areas from early eighties. As a result, the old forms of caste-feudal exploitation changed and new forms took their place. Alongside, and in relation to this, new features also emerged in the rural political power structure. In the first section, we have tried to identify how imperialism has removed feudalism to serve its own interest at one end and how, on the other end, it has contributed to its survival in a new form. We have tried to grasp this removal / renovation dialectics in the transformation process of semi-feudalism. We have also tried to show how the bureaucratic capitalist and feudal production relations are remaining intertwined. In the second section, we have made an attempt to trace the path of the change of the rural political power structure. In particular, we have tried to understand the role of the parliamentary political parties in this process. Lastly, we have given our views on certain controversial issues.</p>
<p>(3) 它建立在国家机器直接庇护的基础之上。官僚资本主义在八十年代初开始在农村地区发展。这种发展的结果是，旧的种姓制-封建制的剥削形式发生了改变，新的剥削形式取而代之。与此伴随浮现的是农村政权结构新的特征。在第一部分，我们将尝试去辨明：一方面，帝国主义到底是怎样地摒弃部分封建制度以满足其自身的利益；另外一方面，帝国主义是如何帮助封建制度以一种新的形式存在下来的。</p>

CPM, after assuming power in 1977, further augmented the process. Imperialism directed and controlled land reform of eighties reduced the amount of land under the possession of the old lords (mainly higher caste) to a great extent. CPM played the role of local agent in this process.Besides, division of landholdings among jotedar households also resulted in a decline in the number of big holdings (Though we can still see big jotedars in some areas). But what are the results of all these? CPM and some intellectuals say that non-existence of big jotedars amounts to the extinction of feudal system and development of capitalist agriculture in our State. It is true that in many areas share-croppers are entering into monetary contract with the landowners instead of crop-sharing, peasants are buying fertilizer, seeds, pesticides etc. from the market; they are marketing their produce; the use of agricultural implements like tractors, power-tillers is on the increase; unlike in Congress period, the landless laborers are no longer remaining tied with the jotedars like bonded labor, they are receiving money wages. In short, money circulation has increased, commodity exchange or market has developed. Do these necessarily mean that caste-feudalism has disappeared from Paschim Banga? There is no denying the fact that capitalist production relations have made inroad in our agriculture. But what is the nature of this capitalism?</p>
<p>六十年代，印度人民在纳萨尔派的领导下摧毁了国大党走狗乔特卡尔的无上权威。1977年，印共马在掌权之后更是促进了这种进程。八十年代，由帝国主义引导并控制的土地改革很大程度上减少了（主要是高种性）旧领主的土地持有量。印共马在这个进程中扮演了帝国主义的地方代理人的角色。除此之外，对乔特达尔家庭进行的土地再分配也导致了大地主数量的减少（尽管我们到现在还能在一些地区看到大乔特达尔的存在）。但所有这些举动的结果是什么？印共马和一些知识分子声称我邦的大乔特达尔已经消失，封建制度已经被摧毁，资本主义制度的农业已经在我邦建立起来。事实上，的确，许多地区的佃农（收益分成佃农——译者注）得以用货币地租取代了实物地租，农民得以从市场购买化肥，种子，农药等等；他们可以在市场上自由出售自己的产品；农业机械诸如拖拉机、耕耘机的应用正在上升；不像国大党独裁时期，失去土地的劳工不再被乔特达尔以像是债役工的形式紧紧禁锢，他们现在可以得到货币工资了。简而言之，货币流通是增加了，商品交易所和市场都有所发展。但这些变化必然地证明了种姓制-封建制已经从西孟加拉邦消失了吗？毋庸置疑，资本主义的生产关系已经侵袭到了我邦的农业当中。但是，这种资本主义的性质是什么？</p>
<p>We should have very clear understanding on the nature of changes that have taken place in our agricultural sector. Only then we can understand which class in the rural areas is holding political power and what is the nature of this class? We have to find out what kind of changes have been brought about in the political structure of the ruling class by these changes in the economic scenario of the rural areas. Only then we can frame correct slogans for rousing the broad peasant masses against this class. Thus we shall be able to identify the concrete forms of their oppression and decide on the correct tactics for struggle. From the increase in monetary transactions and development of commodity exchange and market relations we cannot conclude that feudalism has been annihilated and capitalism is developing in an unrestricted manner.</p>
<p>我们应该清楚地认识到这种在我邦农业部门滋长的资本主义的性质。只有做出这样的认识，我们才能明白正在农村地区掌握政权的到底是什么阶级，而这种阶级的性质又是什么？我们必须找出到底是哪些类型的变化在农村地区的经济前景中发挥作用，造就了当今统治阶级的政治结构。只有做出这样的认识之后，我们才能拟定确实无误的口号，唤起广大农民群众一同为反抗统治阶级而斗争。因此，我们应该辨明统治者压迫的具体形式并为此制定正确的斗争策略。仅仅从货币交易量的上升，商品交易所和市场关系的扩张中，我们并不能这么草率地得出封建制度已经被摧毁，资本主义正在蓬勃发展的结论。</p>
<p>We have to examine how the surplus left with the direct producers after the necessary deduction due to production cost and cost of livelihood, is extracted by the ruling class. Is this surplus extraction done with the help of extra economic power or by economic means? On the basis of this criterion we have to characterize our state’s agrarian economy.Capitalism is characterized by economic exploitation. A capitalist enters into an agreement with free laborer. Wages of workers are determined by the value of their labor power. Value of labor power is the cost of subsistence of a worker and his family so that a new laborer is born. Like the value of any other commodity being determined by its production cost, value of labor power is also determined by the production and reproduction cost of labor power. So here equal values are exchanged. No one is deceiving anyone. But, suppose a worker is working for 8 hours in the field of production. Suppose, in only 3 hours’ labor he is producing value equal to the value of his labor power. So the remaining value which he is producing in the rest 5 hours will be appropriated by the capitalist. This is his profit or surplus value. So, despite the fact that a capitalist may give wages to a worker equal to the value of his labor power in the field of exchange, the former can extract surplus value from the laborer in the field of production. However, in the capitalist system politics plays an important role in the determination of wages. That discussion is out of place here. Capitalists try to maximize profit through producing as much as possible at low cost. So they try to improve the technique of production. In brief, capitalists can extract profit through an economic way and without applying force. This way of exploitation is mainly economic.</p>
<p>我们必须要考察，在扣除了直接生产者由生产成本和生活成本所决定的必要消费之后，这些由直接生产者所生产的剩余产品是如何被统治阶级所无偿获取的。而这种对剩余产品无偿的占有又是否是在超经济权力或者经济手段的帮助下实行的？基于这种标准，我们必须明确我国农业经济的特征。资本主义的基本特征就是经济剥削。一个资本家会和一个“自由的”劳动者缔结契约。工人的工资数额由他们劳动力的价值所决定。劳动力的价值就是一个工人仅可维持自己和家人生计并让他的子女得以成长为和他一样的劳动者所需的价值。和其他所有的商品的价值一样，劳动力的价值也同样由劳动力生产和再生产的价值所决定。所以，在这里一切都是等价交换，童叟无欺。但是不妨假设一个工人每天在生产领域工作8小时。假设他只需3个小时的劳动所创造的价值就足以等同他自身劳动力的价值。那么显然，他在剩下5个小时里创造的那些剩余的价值都被资本家给无偿地占有了。这就是属于资本家的利润，或者说剩余价值。所以事实就是如此：尽管在交换领域里，一个资本家可能会“公正地”付给一个工人等同于他劳动力的价值的工资；但在生产领域里，前者实际上掠夺了本属于后者且由后者所创造的剩余价值。当然，资本主义体系也同样在决定工资数额方面起到了重大作用，在这里就不加以展开了。资本家永远都在试图通过降低生产成本以牟取最大的利润。因此他们会想方设法地提高生产技术。简而言之，资本家无需施加暴力就可以通过一种经济方式获得利润，而这种剥削的形式主要是经济上的。</p>
<p>But the thing is different in feudalism. Landlords/jotedars do not bother themselves about the method of production. Peasants cultivate while feudal lords try to extract as much rent as possible from them through social and political power. This is known as surplus extraction from the peasants through extra economic coercive measures i.e. through the force of power. However, extra economic surplus extraction may not always take the form of open application of brute force. For example, cultivation through engaging wage laborer may seem apparently to be a kind of capitalist mode of exploitation by economic means. But, we have seen in our discussion that jotedars may force the peasants to cultivate at a very low wages (lower than the value of their labor power) by applying various extra economic methods. It is also a kind of extra economic exploitation. As the peasants are not left with any surplus, they also cannot devote anything for the improvement of the technique of production.</p>
<p>但在封建制度中，情况就变得不一样了。地主/乔特达尔就不会因为生产方式而困扰。封建地主会通过对耕种的农民动用他们的社会权力乃至政治权力以收取尽可能多的最大数额的地租（而全然不顾农民的死活——译者注）。这种众所周知的对农民施加的剥削行径需要付诸超经济剥削，比如说暴力加以执行。然而，超经济剥削可能不仅仅是以这种公然的付诸暴力存在。比如说，被雇佣的劳动者通过耕种获取工资，这看起来就像是一种资本主义形式下通过经济手段行使的剥削。但是，我们回顾我们前面的讨论可以发现，乔特达尔可能会用各种超经济手段强迫农民以极低的工资（比他们劳动力的价值还要低）为他们耕种。这也同样是一种（封建制度下的——译者注）超经济剥削。当农民被盘剥的一无所有的时候，他们也完全无力为提高生产技术做出一分一毫的贡献了。</p>
<p>So the development of agriculture is thwarted. To stop this surplus extraction from the peasants, eviction of jotedars/landlords and distribution of their land among the peasants is an important pre-requisite. This task cannot be accomplished without the new democratic revolution. During the Congress period big jotedars used to extract this surplus by means of their monopoly ownership of land. At one end, they used to use their private army (lethel bahini) for collecting rent from the tenants and on the other end, with the ulterior motive of exploiting the peasants they used the caste system.Big jotedars were mainly from high caste background (mainly from Brahmin, Kayastha and Baidya caste) and ‘low’ caste people like Bagdi, Bauri, Dome, Ruidas, Namoshudro etc. were landless peasants. Caste system was utilized to keep them away from landownership. They used to be compelled to work on jotedars’ land on nominal wages. In most cases wages were not paid in money.</p>
<p>因此，农业的发展实际上受到了阻碍。要停止这种对农民的剥削，必须首先剥夺乔特达尔和大地主的土地并将之分给农民。要完成这个任务，在完成新民主主义革命之前是做不到的。在国大党独裁期间，大乔特达尔经常通过垄断土地所有权以进行剥削。一方面，他们经常动用他们的私人武装（原文为lethel bahini，即印度的民团——译者注）向佃农收租；另外一方面，他们则是别有用心地利用种姓制度来盘剥农民。大乔特达尔往往是高种姓出身（婆罗门，凯亚斯塔人， Baidya种性），而像是Bauri, Dome, Ruidas, Namoshudro等等这样的“低”种姓就只会是失地农民了。种姓制度被大乔特达尔用来阻止他们拥有土地。他们过去常常只能被迫在乔特达尔的土地上拿着微薄的工资劳作。而在大多数情况下，工资并不是以货币支付的。</p>
<p>They would be given paddy or rice and / or miserly half-meal in lieu of their inhuman and bone breaking labor. This is why dalits were the most struggling force in the Naxalite movement. After CPM assumed power some changes were seen in Paschim Banga situation. Though the path breaking struggles of sixties and seventies weakened the old type big jotedars to a large extent, a process of implementing green revolution under the imperialist directive by CPM was initiated during the eighties.Through this a process of transforming old type of feudalism was unleashed and development of capitalism of a new type was strengthened. In this process imperialist penetration in the agricultural sector was further deepened. A neo- jotedar class came into being through this removal and renovation dialectics of the transformation process of semi-feudalism.(This does not mean that old jotedars were finished. They coped with the new situation and transformed themselves into the changed format. Neo-jotedar means those using new forms of exploitation. Neo-jotedar class includes local party-panchayat bosses, co-op directors, social and religious institution heads etc. and also those old jotedars who transformed themselves.In general, those persons who are at the helm of rural political power structure and are using new forms and methods of exploitation. Neo-jotedars came mainly from higher caste background, but some OBC and advanced dalit caste people were also added.) The neo-jotedars are not the owners of big landholdings like their old counterparts. The decisively important consideration is to determine the nature of this new class and also their mode of exploitation. We have to analyze the nature of surplus extraction and use of this surplus with reference to the relationship of the neo-jotedar class with imperialism and state. The mode of surplus extraction is the key factor in the determination of their mode of rule. The source and modes of exploitation of the neo-jotedars are varied and diverse and therefore, the mode of their rule is also complex and all-embracing. We have to understand the modes of exploitation and form of political rule in a mutually inter-related manner, which is a pre-requisite for the correct understanding about the local political power structure.</p>
<p>乔特达尔会用水稻或者大米/或者仅仅用一点吃剩的残羹冷炙来以支付失地农民为此付出的似非人所为般繁杂艰苦的劳动。这就是为什么达利人（贱民）是纳萨尔派革命运动中最富斗争性的力量。在印共马掌权之后，西孟加拉邦的情况发生了一些变化。尽管六十年代到七十年代的开创性斗争极大地削弱了旧形式的大乔特达尔，但在八十年代，印共马发起了始终处于帝国主义管控之下的绿色革命。在绿色革命中，旧形式的封建制度的转化进程加快了，新形式的资本主义的发展加强了。在这个进程中，帝国主义在农业部门的渗透也更强了。一个新乔特达尔阶级随着这种对半封建主义革新和祛除的辩证过程应运而生。（这并不意味着旧有的乔特达尔阶级已经被终结。他们应对新的情况做出了新的蜕变。新乔特达尔指的是那些运用新式剥削方式的人。新乔特达尔阶级包括了地方党组织-村务委员会的头头， 合作社经理人，社会和宗教机构的首脑等等，还有部分成员是从旧乔特达尔阶级转化而来的。总的来说，这些农村政权结构的核心人物都在运用着新的剥削方式和方法。新乔特达尔大都是高种姓出身，但有些其他落后阶层【OBC=Other Backward Class，即“其他落后阶层”，是传统上也属于低级种姓的人群——译者注】和达利人中的上层阶层也在其中）新乔特达尔不像他们的旧同行一样拥有那样多的土地。要对此做出确实无误的判断，就是要明确这个新生阶级和它所采取的剥削方式的本质。我们必须分析各种剥削的本质以及他们对剥削所得的使用反映出的新乔特达尔和帝国主义和邦政府之间的关系。这些剥削方式是我们明确他们统治方式的关键因素。由于新乔特达尔剥削方式和剥削手段多种多样，范围深广，因此他们的统治方式也复杂难明，无所不包。我们必须以一种相互关联的方式去了解剥削方式和政治统治的类型，为对当地政权结构的正确认识打下基础，做好准备。</p>

According to the official data, 4 percent of the rural households own one-third of the agricultural land. Like old jotedars, they also take the share of the produce of the tenants without devoting any labor at all. In our state, about 10 to 16 percent of agricultural land is devoted to barga cultivation. The tenants are predominantly poor and landless. In some areas of the state, the tenants are entering into monetary agreement with the owners instead of crop-sharing. As a result, some left intellectuals opine that old feudal share cropping system is being replaced by the capitalist land-lease out system.<br>尽管不像旧乔特达尔持有那样多的土地，新乔特达尔却还是占有着最大多数的农业用地。官方数据显示，4%的农村家庭占有了1/3的农田。和旧乔特达尔一样，他们也无需从事任何劳动就可以在佃农身上收租。在我邦，大概10-16%的农田是由佃农耕种的。佃农们都极度贫穷而没有土地。在我邦的一些地区，佃农和地主签订了契约，用货币地租取代了实物地租。因此，有些左翼学者据此声称，旧的封建主义的租佃分成制度已经为资本主义的土地租赁制度所取代了。</p>
<p>They are looking only at the appearance of the thing and not into the essence of it. The amount of crop sharing or money rent payable to the owner depends on the social, economic and political power of tenants, no matter whether the rent is paid in kind or in money. In many a cases, they have succeeded in raising their share through struggle. However, the tenants in our state are largely poor and the owners extract surplus from them by virtue of their monopoly of landownership. As the tenants are left with no surplus, they cannot do anything for the development of cultivation. They subsist under tremendous hardship after whatever little is left after rent payment. More so because of exorbitant increase in the cost of cultivation and low prices of their produce.</p>
<p>他们只看到了事物的表象而看不到其中的实质。地主能收到的实物地租或者货币地租的数额取决于当时社会，经济的状况和佃农的政治力量大小，而与这种支付方式是实物还是货币无关。在很多情况下，佃农通过斗争成功地提高了他们自己得到的分成。然而，在我国，绝大多数的佃农都因为地主通过对土地所有权的垄断进行的盘剥而极度贫穷。当佃农被榨尽了最后的一点剩余（的体力，财产）之后，他们也不能为种植业的“发展”做些什么了。他们在重重重压下苟延残喘，在交出地租之后几近一无所有。这种境遇更因种植成本的离谱增长以及他们的农产品遭遇到的低价收购而愈演愈烈。</p>
<p>The phenomena of reverse tenancy i.e. capitalist cultivation on large scale by the rich peasants by taking land on lease from the poor peasants are almost not found in Bengal. So we can conclude that share tenancy is capitalist in appearance but feudal in essence. Those who portray share cropping as capitalist, actually have the bad intention of denying the task of seizing land from landlords and distribute it among the share croppers. Their real aim is to keep this task out of the land reform program. During the last 34 years CPM did not give any land title to the tenants and TMC is also keeping mum on this issue. But, in the decades of 60’s and 70’s tenants in many areas snatched away land through struggle. In some areas jotedars themselves gave up a portion of land to the tenants to pacify them. That’s why, later, the big landowners switched over to cultivation by engaging wage labor in place of tenancy cultivation.</p>
<p>而那种“倒过来”的租佃关系，比如富农从贫农那里租用土地展开的资本主义式大生产，已在西孟加拉邦差不多绝迹了。因此，我们可以下结论说，分成佃农制看起来是资本主义制度，然而本质上仍然是封建制度。那些将分成佃农制描绘成资本主义制度的人，实际上就是在居心叵测地企图否认我国目前面临着的剥夺地主土地并将之分配给佃农的任务。他们的真正目的就是要将这项任务从土地改革方案中排除出去。在过去的34年里，印共马根本没有给赋予佃农任何土地所有权，而草根国大党也仍旧在这个问题上保持沉默（尽管部分佃农是得到了土地，但由于印共马随时都可以无条件地剥夺佃农已经分配到的土地，所以说土地所有权并没有赋予给佃农——译者注）。但是在六十到七十年代，许多地区的佃农通过斗争夺回了土地。在一些地区，乔特达尔自己出让了一部分土地以图安抚起来斗争的佃农。这就是为什么随后大地主在种植业方面转而用雇佣劳动制取代了租佃制。</p>
<h3 id="WAGE-SYSTEM-׃"><a href="#WAGE-SYSTEM-׃" class="headerlink" title="WAGE SYSTEM ׃"></a>WAGE SYSTEM ׃</h3><h3 id="薪酬体系："><a href="#薪酬体系：" class="headerlink" title="薪酬体系："></a>薪酬体系：</h3><p>Change has taken place also in the system of cultivation through wage labor deployment. In sixties and seventies, the agricultural laborers were like bonded labor. In lieu of scanty amount of paddy or rice they used to work on the jotedars’ land throughout the day (Bandha or Mahindari system). Because of long drawn class struggle this system is no longer in vogue. Today they work on daily wage basis. The left intellectuals are over-prompt in their conclusion once again that landowners are cultivating their land by the capitalist method of free wage labor deployment. Free labor means free in both ways- free in terms of selling their labor power and also free from the ownership of the means of production.</p>
<p>雇佣劳动制也同样在农业体系里带来了变化。在六十到七十年代，雇农大多和隶属于乔特达尔的债役工无异。他们在乔特达尔的土地上劳作终日，所获不过极少量水稻或者大米 (Bandha 或 Mahindari制度)。归功于长年累月的阶级斗争，这种制度终于不再盛行。如今的他们在劳作时有了每日基本工资。那些左翼学者们又一次迫不及待地下结论说，地主们是在用资本主义的自由的雇佣劳动制的方式雇佣他们来耕种自己的土地。但是，劳动自由意味着这两方面的自由：能够以任意形式出卖自己的劳动力的自由；得以掌握生产资料而不因此受到奴役的自由。</p>
<p>We have to see: are they really free in both respects? In the rural areas of our state there are landless laborers to the tune of 90 lakhs. This figure is on the increase day by day. According to 1991 census 46 percent of the peasants are landless laborers. The figure has risen to 57 percent in 2001. Industries have not developed sufficiently to absorb this vast section of the landless peasant population. So they are compelled to accept very low wages in the agricultural sector. 2005-06 Government of India report shows that while agricultural sector wages are rising India-wide, they are falling in our state. Wages in cultivation are so low that one or two members of every family have to move either to other districts or to other states. The poor people of Birbhum flock to relatively developed agricultural parts of Bardhaman district during the peak season or are compelled to join the unorganized labor army of industrial zones of Bardhaman.</p>
<p>我们必须看到：雇农真的在这两方面都自由了吗？在我邦的农村地区，有着总额高达900万的失地农民。这个数字正在一天天地攀升。据1991年的人口普查，46%的农民没有土地。这个数据在2001年上升到了57%。工业并不足以发展到吸纳绝大部分的失地农民人口的程度。所以他们被迫使接受极其低廉的工资而从事农业。2005-06印度政府报告显示，在全印度的农业部门的工资有所上涨的时候，我们邦的工资反而下降了。我邦的农业部门的工资是如此之低，以至于每个家庭都不得不有一到两个成员迁徙到其他县或者其他邦去。比尔普姆的穷苦人民要么在高峰季节涌入临近的巴尔达曼县农业发达的地区，要么被迫加入到巴尔达曼工业区里未经训练的劳动者大军的行列中去。</p>
<p>They also are engaged in illegal sale of coal from open coal pits or poppy seeds cultivation or in brick-kilns. The construction workers of Murshidabad can be found in any part of the country. People in large groups are migrating to Maharashtra, Tamilnadu, Karnataka, Kerala and Gujarat in search of jobs. The villages are almost devoid of youths. Planning commission report of 2008 says that about 27% of rural youth in Paschim Banga are unemployed. We can infer with certainty that in the agricultural sector the laborers are getting wages less than the value of their labor power. It is a fact that wages in the agricultural sector has increased. But Central government report of 2004-05 said that 94.5% of agricultural laborers in our state are getting wages less than Central government stipulated minimum wages. So we can say that, they are no longer tied with individual jotedars. But now their situation is that, they are like bonded labor to the whole agricultural sector. Many of them are forced to work as cheap labor in the bureaucratic capitalist industrial sector.</p>
<p>他们也同样进入到了一些非法行当：在露天煤矿坑里劳作，种植罂粟，或是在黑砖窑里劳作。穆尔斯希达巴德的建筑工人遍布全国各地。为了谋生，大批大批的人群移居到了马哈拉施特拉、泰米尔纳德，卡纳坦克邦，喀拉拉邦和古吉拉特邦。农村里几乎没有年轻人了。规划委员会2008年的报道提到西孟加拉邦27%的农村青壮找不到工作。我们可以十分确信地推断出，在农业部门中，劳动者如今所得的工资还要小于他们自身劳动力的价值。固然，农业部门的工资的普遍上涨是事实。但是中央政府2004-05年报告指出，我邦94.5%的雇农拿到的工资甚至要低过中央政府所规定的最低工资。因此，我们可以说：的确，雇农是不再被以个体形式存在的乔特达尔所奴役了；但是在如今，他们就像是隶属于整个农业部门的债役工。他们当中的许多人不得不在官僚资本主义的工业部门中充当廉价劳动力存在。</p>
<p>The point to be noted in this connection is that these rich peasants, money lender and cold storage owners together constitute the class of neo-jotedars who exploit poor peasants with active support from party-panchayat and state administration. Poor peasants like their landless counterparts also work at low wages on the land held by jotedars or migrate to work as unorganized cheap labor either in cities or in other States. Those who discover independent capitalism in agriculture, ignore two facts. One, the number of poor and landless peasants is increasing every year, implying that consolidation of small holdings into big farms, thus paving the way for capitalist agriculture, is nonexistent.Two, even today 72% of the direct producers cultivate for subsistence and not for market. So, imperialism-guided and state-backed capitalism in agriculture (which is of bureaucratic nature) is working towards the persistence of the feudal relations, giving them new forms and internalizing these relations in its surplus value extraction process.Thus semi-feudal agriculture and bureaucratic capitalist industry (and also service sector) are mutually contributing towards each others existence and reinforcing each other.Without semi-feudal agriculture the imperialists and their comprador capitalists could not exploit cheap labor in this manner. On the other hand, if uninterrupted growth of independent capitalism could replace the imperialism-induced controlled and limited growth of bureaucratic capitalism, the neo-jotedars also could not engage poor and landless peasants at such low wages (competition will equalize wages). Because of low wages and job-uncertainties (on an average, agricultural laborers get work for 112 days per year) the agricultural laborers very often enter into extra-economic agreement with the jotedars. These agreements include taking advance on the basis of a prior agreement that they will remain reserved to work at low wages during the season, to get credit also in the same terms. Those like SUCI who think that the increase in the number of agricultural laborers every year is a clear indication of the transformation of the feudal production relations into capitalist one, actually fail to see how the feudal relations are working under the capitalist guise.</p>
<p>要指出的是，在党-村务委员会和邦政府行政体系的大力支持下互相勾结而剥削贫农的关系中，富农，放债人，冷库拥有者（凭借着冷库囤积居奇的投机者，后文有介绍——译者注）构成了新乔特达尔阶级。贫农和他们的失地同侪一样，也要么在乔特达尔的土地上领着极低工资而工作，要么就到其他城市或者其他邦里充当未经训练的廉价劳动力。那些能在我邦农业发现“独立自主的资本主义”的人对两点视而不见：一，贫农以及失地农民的数量每年都在攀升，这暗示着小片的土地正在被大型农场所兼并，因此所谓“为资本主义农业铺平了道路”并不符合事实。二，即使在如今，72%的直接生产者都仍仅能靠耕作勉强维持生计而不能从市场得益。因此，受帝国主义控制且有邦政府支持的资本主义（这就是官僚主义的本质）力图在农业中保留封建的生产关系，并给予它们新的形式并加以内化，为其剥削剩余价值的大业服务。所以，半封建制度的农业和官僚资本主义制度的工业（服务业）都彼此勾结，互为表里。没有半封建制的农业，帝国主义和它们豢养的买办资本家都不可能获取这样廉价的劳动力；另外一方面，如果独立自主的资本主义不受干扰的发展能够取代官僚资本主义那种受帝国主义诱导、控制和限制的发展，新乔特达尔也不可能用如此低廉的工资来雇佣贫农和失地农民了（竞争会使工资趋于平均化）。因为极低工资和工作的不稳定性（雇农平均来看一年只有112天能找到工作），雇农经常要和乔特达尔签订额外的经济协议。这些协定利用了先前协定中要求雇农以低薪为代价在整个季度内保留工作的条款，来允许雇农们在同一时期内向新乔特达尔阶级赊购生活物资（这是半殖民地种植园常用的手段，中国“工业园区”里也曾发生过。结果一部分雇工们就被欠债捆绑在雇主们手下不断劳动，无法另外寻找工作了——译者注）。像印度社会主义团结中心（SUCI印度社会主义团结中心是印度一个独立元勋在1948年建立的泛左党派，主要活动于西孟加拉邦——译者注）那样，认为每年雇农数目的上升很明显地表示了封建制生产关系向资本主义生产关系转变的学者们，很明显就是没有看到封建的生产关系是如何在资本主义的伪装下运作的。</p>

The majority of 18 million dalits in Bengal are landless peasants. 55% of Bauris, 54% of Bagdis and 64% of Mals are landless. Dalits acquired some land through their struggle during 60’s and 70’s. But they were compelled later to sell off their small plots because of tremendous financial hardships or due to high cost of cultivation. In many cases CPM leaders used to control them through taking away pattas from them. These leaders used them against the small peasants belonging to OBC and thus acted consciously to create an ambience of caste-distrust with the ulterior motive of breaking the class unity among the poor. Dalit masses work as cheap labor in villages. Also they are engaged in the most dirty and dangerous occupations in the industrial and service sector.</p>
<p>有很多失地农民都是达利人。婆罗门教自古以来就不承认他们应有的财产所有权。这种相同的情景也延续到了今日。1800万达利人中的大多数都是失地农民。55%的Bauris，54%的Bagdis和64%的Mals都没有土地。达利人在六十年代到七十年代通过斗争得到了一些土地。但是他们随后又在由高昂的种植成本导致的巨大的财务重负下被迫卖掉这点家当。在很多情况下，印共马的头目常常用夺走他们的帕塔（Patta是pattayam的缩写，意思是一种土地权属证书，这里指1982年印共马领导的土改之后获得土地的原佃农取得的土地权属证书——译者注）的方式来控制他们。这些头目利用他们来对抗隶属于其他落后阶层（低种姓）的小农，并借此有意识地创造一种使种姓之间相互猜忌的气氛，别有用心地想利用这种措施破坏穷苦人民之间的阶级内部团结。达利群众在农村中作为廉价劳动力存在。他们也被同样地被驱使到了工业部门和服务业部门最肮脏也是最危险的的工作岗位上。</p>
<p>Many intellectuals, ruling class media and parliamentary party leaders propagate that land reforms are already accomplished and seizing land today amounts to occupying the property of ryots. Thus public opinion is created to eternally deprive dalits from land ownership. A rich section has been created from among some advanced dalit castes, such as Namo shudro, Poundra kshatriya, Ruidas etc. By means of netagiri, business and government services they have prospered and become part of neo-jotedar class. Imperialism and state have thus degenerated a section of those who struggled against old jotedars into new rulers.</p>
<p>许多学者，统治阶级的媒体和议会政党的领袖都扬言说土地改革已经完成，在如今对土地的再分配等同于强抢农民的财产。这种舆论之所以被创造出来，不过是妄图永远剥夺达利人的土地所有权罢了。达利种姓中已经出现了像是Namo shudro, Poundra kshatriya, Ruidas等等的一个富裕阶层。通过在尼达吉利学校，公司和政府的就职，他们获得了一定成功，跃升到了新乔特达尔阶级。帝国主义和邦政府本身也就和这些通过反抗旧乔特达尔而摇身一变的新统治者同流合污，站到了一起。</p>

They lease out pump sets, tractors and power tillers and lend fertilizer, seeds and pesticides to the poor peasants on condition that the peasants must sell their produce to them at considerably low prices. Poor peasants enter into such contracts because cultivation cost is increasing steeply day by day and secondly because neo-jotedars control the local wholesale trade of agricultural produce. Poor peasants cannot hoard grain for sale later at higher prices. Neo-jotedars who are themselves party or panchayat boss or purchased those post holders, control the local storages. Their control on potato bonds is a case in point.</p>
<p>我们农村地区的绝大多数（78%）人口都是贫穷而没有土地的。这个数字每年都在增长。新乔特达尔阶级通过多种方式剥削贫农。他们在贫农必须以极低的价格将农产品卖给他们的条件下向贫农出租水泵机组，拖拉机和耕耘机，也借出化肥，种子和农药。贫农之所以会签订这种协议，是因为：一，种植成本的日益提高；二，新乔特达尔阶级垄断了当地的农产品批发贸易。贫农无法囤积谷物以待价格上涨之际卖出。本身就是党、村干部或收买了这些人的新乔特达尔阶级控制了当地的冷藏设备。他们对马铃薯储藏的控制就是此类情况一个典型的例子。</p>
<p>“Those who grow potato through rain and sun can never gain. On the contrary… they are caught in debt trap… Potato business is exclusively under the control of storehouse owners and mahajans. They set potato prices. They are also able to create artificial scarcity during the time of necessity. They even gamble in the fertilizer market… They create scarcity in this market in such a way that a peasant will be given one sack of potato seeds if he buys two sacks of IFFCO fertilizer from them… where from a marginal peasant can secure so much money? Cooperative Banks play just a trivial role to rescue them. So money lending business goes on unabated. What are the terms of settlement here?You take as much credit as you require and cultivate. But you will have to sell 75 to 80% of your crop to the money lender on his terms. In case of crop failure the credit will be carried forward to the next year. This is the process how the credit accumulated and a time will come when the money lender will swallow his land by compelling him to give his thumb impression on a piece of paper. Government introduced potato bonds with much fanfare in order to protect the potato growers. Has any one ever enquired to know who actually controls these bonds? Potato business is of course remunerative. But 20% of this profit is going to the rich peasants, 40% to the moneylenders and the rest to the cold storage owners.

One way of controlling poor peasants is to take away their pattas and deposit them with the local party office. Patta of one peasant is sometimes given to another, thus pitting one against other and sucking both parties. We have got a new term in the process-‘pattadas’ (literally, patta-slave). In many instances, vest land instead of being distributed among the landless, is simply swallowed by the neo-jotedars. A report by Nirmal Mukherjee and Debabrata Banerjee reveals that towards the end of 1981, the undistributed vested land amounted to 3.5 lakh acres. From 1981 to 1993, 94 thousand acres were distributed. Out of these there is no trace of 80 thousand acres. Neo-jotedars have definitely stolen these lands with active party and state backing. 4 lakhs peasants and 15% of the tenants have become landless (Ananda Bazar Patrika, 8-11-2004). They are those who are compelled to sell off their land to the neo-jotedars as they are unable to bear the cultivation cost. These incidents show, how this party, panchayat, police and administration nexus is working and how this network is being used by the neo-jotedars to control the poor peasants and sucking their surplus through extra economic methods.</p>
<p>尽管新乔特达尔不是像旧乔特达尔一样的大地主，他们也在党，村务委员会，行政部门和警察的大力支持下控制了相当大数额的土地。一种控制贫农的方式就是夺走他们的帕塔（土地证）并通过地方党委役使他们。一个农民被夺走的帕塔（土地证）有时被赏赐给另一个，这样就可以在挑拨他们互斗的同时剥削他们二者。很多时候，征收来的土地并没有被分配给无地农民，而是被新乔特达尔分子给私吞了。由Nirmal Mukherjee和Debabrata Banerjee做出的报告揭示了在1981年年尾，尚未分配的既得土地高达35万英亩。而从1981年到1993年，仅有9.4万英亩的土地被分配。此外还有8万英亩的土地不知所踪。显然，新乔特达尔绝对是在党和邦的大力支持下将这些土地窃为己有了。40万的农民和15%的佃农还因此失去了土地（欢喜市场报， 8-11-2004）。他们都是因为无法负担种植成本而被迫将土地出售给新乔特达尔的。这些事件揭示了这个党，村务委员会，警察和行政部门的联合是如何被新乔特达尔用于控制贫农，并通过超经济手段从他们身上榨取剩余产品的。</p>

However, its form has changed since eighties. Many cooperative credit societies were formed during CPM regime. Neo-jotedars are majority in all the managing committees of the credit cooperatives. A survey report has revealed that rich peasants, who constitute only 11% of the rural population, are taking 45% of the total cooperative credit. As the poor peasants are unable to repay their loans, they are denied further credit. 61% of the loan requirement of the poor peasants comes from the money lenders. Even the people on the top of the credit cooperatives are involved in money lending business by taking loans from cooperatives and other banks as highly favored clients. (The result of land reforms in West Bengal- Kartik Pal).</p>
<p>“马哈贾尼”（即高利贷）是一种正在扩张的剥削方式。然而，它的形式在八十年代发生了改变。在印共马统治期间，许多信贷合作社团体建立起来了。新乔特达尔阶级占据了这些信贷合作社的管理委员会席位的多数。据一份报告所示，只占农村人口11%的富农就用去了所有合作社总计45%的贷款。而当贫农无力还贷时，他们就被剥夺了继续从合作社借贷的权力。61%的贫农的贷款要求都是由放债人制定的。即使是信贷合作社的高层人物也都凭着其备受青睐的客户身份从合作社和其他银行贷款，和借贷公司搅和在一起（归功于西孟加拉邦的土地改革）。</p>
<p>The system of giving credit to the poor peasants on condition that they will be liable to sell off their crop at a price lower than the market price to the mahajans is rampant in today’s rural Bengal. Peasants have no other way to take high interest bearing loans from these neo-jotedar cum mahajans to cover their cost of cultivation. So they have to sell off their grain at a lower price to this mahajans cum grain traders (distress sale). In this way this neo-jotedars have amassed large fortunes as middleman.</p>
<p>这种面向贫农的，建立在让他们不得不将他们的农作物以低于市场价的价格出售给马哈贾尼（放债人——译者注）的条件之上的借贷体系，在今日的西孟加拉邦日益猖獗。除了向这些新乔特达尔借高利贷，要弥补种植成本大洞的农民别无他法。因此他们不得不以极低的价格向马哈贾尼的粮商卖出（低价抛售）自己的农作物。新乔特达尔以这种方式在其中充当掮客大发横财。</p>

Vaidyanathan committee has proposed that only those who avail co-op bank services will be allowed to stay in the co-op bank management. Government will have no representation in the co-op director board. This has the obvious implication that the influential neo-jotedars (i.e. party and panchayat big guns) will occupy the co-op bank director boards and in the process their grip over the rural credit system will be tightened.</p>
<p>在掌权以后，印共马开始大张旗鼓地大搞合作社运动。合作社同样是一种对贫农的额外的经济剥削工具。在前面，我们已经讨论过了信贷合作社是如何像一个压榨血肉的剥削机器一样运作的。现任政府正在考虑对农村信贷合作社进行撤换。Vaidyanathan委员会已经提议只有那些能为合作银行业务提供效益的信贷合作社才能被允许留在合作银行管理体系当中。现任政府将不会在这个董事会中设置代表。这无疑是预示着这些有着支配性地位的新乔特达尔（也就是党和村务委员会的大佬们）将要全面占据合作银行的董事会，而他们对农村信贷体系的管控也将愈发收紧。</p>
<p>During 70’s and 80’s the peasants in the fishery areas of Haroa, Shasan, Beleghata etc., areas of North 24 Parganas, struggled hard and ousted the big jotedars. Many fishery co-operatives were formed. CPM leaders came to the top of these co-ops (and now, TMC leaders). They gave meager sums of money to the poor co-op members and swallowed the remaining lucrative sum of profit themselves. Afterwards, these neo-jotedars leased out the same fisheries to the ousted old jotedars in a concealed manner. Of course, they got money as a token of gratitude from the ousted jotedars. To suppress any opposition against these conspiratorial acts they formed an armed gang of cadre force. The big palatial party offices are like old jotedars Kachari Bari (court-house). They are like police outposts to carry surveillance on the local people and outsiders. This incident shows how a section of the leaders of anti-feudal movement have degenerated and they themselves became new feudal lords.</p>
<p>在七十到八十年代期间，Haroa, Shasan, Beleghata等北方24县地区的渔民和农民在经过了一番艰苦的斗争后终于将赶跑了大乔特达尔。许多渔业合作社建立了起来。印共马的头头们占据了这些合作社的高层（现在是联合政府的头头们）。他们用微薄的薪酬打发穷苦的合作社成员，自己却吞并了丰厚的利润。此后，这些新乔特达尔还暗地里将这些同样（以前就属于旧乔特达尔）的渔区出租了给被赶跑的旧乔特达尔。当然了，他们会收到感恩戴德的旧乔特达尔的钱的孝敬。为了镇压任何因他们的倒行逆施而引起的反抗，他们建立了一支由他们的骨干力量组成的持械匪帮。富丽堂皇的党办公厅和旧乔特达尔的Kachari Bari（公堂）的奢华程度也没什么两样。他们就像警察的哨所一般紧紧地监视着本地人和外地人。这些事件展示了，一部分所谓的“领袖”是如何在反封建的运动中堕落，从而蜕变为新的封建领主的。</p>

Neo-jotedars act as their local agents. Because of implementing the green revolution agenda during eighties in this state, the sale of hybrid seeds, fertilizer, pesticides and other agricultural implements of the imperialists and their agents increased manifold. As dealers and distributors of the domestic and foreign big companies, they earned a lot selling these agro-inputs. They lease out these inputs to the poor peasants on condition that the latter will sell their crop to the former at low prices. Then they sell the agro products to the industrial sector.</p>
<p>帝国主义和本土的买办资产阶级通过剪刀差的形式在农业进行剥削——即低价收购农产品而高价售卖工业品。新乔特达尔就是它们在地方上的代理人。因为八十年代绿色革命议程在我国的实施，由帝国主义和它们的代理人所把持的杂交种子，化肥，农药和其他农业机械的销售种类增加了。作为本国和外国大公司的经销商和分销商的他们通过售卖这些农业投入品（即前文的化肥等——译者注）获利颇丰。他们以贫农用低价售卖他们的作物为条件，将这些农业投入品借贷给贫农随后又将农产品卖给工业部门。（这个实际上类似于“买青苗”——译者注）</p>
<p>The industrialists also depend on these agents to get raw materials at cheap prices. Jute cultivation is one example. These agents in keeping with an understanding with the jute mill owners buy jute from the cultivators at low prices. The jute mill owners’ on the fake plea of dearth of jute supply declare lock out to stop wage increase of the laborers. And on the pleas that lock out is going on in the jute mills, these agents compel the peasants to sell off at low prices.Not only the markets for agricultural implements and grain are under their control, the markets for the daily necessities are also controlled by them. They control also the trade and trader’s organizations in the rural small towns. Imperialists and comprador bourgeoisie depend on the neo-jotedars, as reliable agents, for supplying raw materials to industry at low prices and selling industrial products in rural areas. Here also feudal relations keep working amidst capitalist commodity circulation. This proves that commodity circulation, in itself, does not give rise to independent capitalism. It requires the total destruction of feudal and imperialist production relations. Those who, with their long list of commodities in circulation, are keen on proving that independent capitalism has developed in agriculture, ignore these basic facts. For this reason, they are unable to grasp the real character of the (bureaucratic) capitalism that has developed in our agriculture.</p>
<p>实业家们同样要依仗这些代理人来得到廉价的原材料。黄麻种植业就是一个例子。这些从劳动者中低价收购黄麻的代理人始终和黄麻厂业主打的火热。这些黄麻厂业主会谎称黄麻供应中断从而宣布停工以阻止劳动者工资的上涨。当黄麻厂都开始停工的时候，这些代理人就强迫农民以低价卖出黄麻。除了农业机械和粮食市场之外，他们还把持了日用品市场。他们控制了农村小镇的整个贸易和商人组织（商会）。帝国主义和买办资产阶级都要依靠新乔特达尔，他们可靠的代理人，来为工业供应廉价的原材料并将工业品卖给农村地区。在这里，资本主义的商品流通之下仍然有着封建的生产关系发挥着作用。这证明了商品流通，就其本身而言，并不能自己成长为独立自主的资本主义。它（独立自主的资本主义）的存在需要将封建的和帝国主义（植入的）的生产关系彻底摧毁。那些力图用记载着商品流通的长长单子（贸易清单）证明我国农业已经发展出了独立自主的资本主义的学者们显然就对这些基本事实视而不见。正因为如此，他们就无法抓住我邦农业中发展而出的（官僚）资本主义的真正特征。</p>
<h3 id="NEW-IMPERIALIST-PLAN-׃"><a href="#NEW-IMPERIALIST-PLAN-׃" class="headerlink" title="NEW IMPERIALIST PLAN ׃"></a>NEW IMPERIALIST PLAN ׃</h3><h3 id="新的帝国主义计划"><a href="#新的帝国主义计划" class="headerlink" title="新的帝国主义计划"></a>新的帝国主义计划</h3><p>This new plan with reference to our agriculture in particular has the following aspects: First, commercialization of agriculture through contract farming. Peasants will now produce potatoes and tomatoes for Pepsi Company instead of growing paddy. Already Frito Lay Company (a subordinate company of PepsiCo) has purchased 12000 tons of potatoes in six districts through a contract with 18000 peasants. This contract farming has taken place on 1600 acres of land; the company is in complete control over the production process. They finalise a price agreement with the peasants beforehand. The peasants are forced to buy all implements of production from the company. Initially they are offered lucrative prices. When larger number of peasants will be drawn towards the contract, these big corporations will go for price-slash. Here also, as per government plan, the neo-jotedars (mainly party and panchayat bosses) will act as mediators between the company and peasants.</p>
<p>这个有关我邦农业的新计划有以下方面值得注意：第一，通过订单农业进行的农业商品化。农民以后将不再种植水稻，转而为百事公司生产番茄和马铃薯。菲多利公司（一个百事公司的下属公司）已经在六个县里和18000名农民签订了合同，购买了12000吨的马铃薯。这种订单农业已经在总计1600英亩的土地上发展起来了。这些公司可以控制整个生产过程。他们会提前和农民拟定一个最终的关于产品的价格协议。这些农民们不得不从这些公司购买所有的一整套的生产工具。起初他们给出的收购价格往往对农民来说有利可图。但当大量农民被此吸引，纷纷前来签订合同的时候，这些大公司就会很快地开始降价。在此，和在每一个政府计划中一样，新乔特达尔阶级（主要是党和村务委员会的头头）会扮演这些公司和农民之间的斡旋者。</p>
<p>These neo-jotedars will, by hook or by crook, force the peasants to contract farming and thus they will faithfully serve the interest of big capital. Second, the target area of the government’s second green revolution is eastern parts of India. In the States like Punjab, Haryana, western UP- the pilot area of the first green revolution the under ground water has been dried up. Land has become saline. So the imperialist vultures have targeted fertile and water rich eastern India. However, the situation in these states is also not ok. Boro cultivation in our State on large scale has almost exhausted underground water. Arsenic pollution, fertility erosion are the by products. Now, second green revolution (gene revolution) is going to be introduced. This revolution aims at introduction of terminator seeds which will greatly harm our ecology including human living but which will increase production dramatically to augment export.</p>
<p>作为迎合垄断资本的忠实走狗，新乔特达尔会不择手段地强迫农民签订这些合同。第二，现任政府的第二次绿色革命的目的地是在印度东部。在像是旁遮普邦，哈里亚纳邦等第一次绿色革命的西部试点地区，地下水都已经枯竭了，土地也变咸了。因此，这些帝国主义的秃鹫们就盯上了丰饶而又水源充足的印度东部。然而，在这些邦里情况也不见得好。在我邦，大规模的波洛米（一种高产而又需要耗费不少资源的水稻——译者注）种植已经几乎将地下水消耗殆尽。砷污染和土地肥力的下降就是其副产品。现在，第二次绿色革命（基因革命）已经势在必行了。这场所谓的革命意图推广的绝育种子，将会极大地破坏我们人类居住的生态环境，却仅仅是为了极大地提高产量以用于出口。</p>
<p>The peasants, as a result, will be compelled to buy this type of genetically engineered seeds and also specific type of fertilizer and pesticides which goes with such seeds more and more from imperialist corporate giants like Cargill, Monsanto, Mahico etc. So it is clear that, here also, these neo-jotedars will play the role of mediator in this whole process of deeper penetration of imperialism. This mediation will benefit the imperialists because they can use these agents to evict small peasants from land so that big agricultural firms can be formed. Here one can notice a clear alliance between imperialism, state and neo-jotedars. Mamata has, for the time being, put a ban on the use of these harmful seeds. But there is yet no formal ban on contract farming. There is a strong possibility that its implementation will be legalized as a form of PPP model, the new Mamata mantra.</p>
<p>因此农民将被迫不断地去从嘉吉，孟山都，Mahico等帝国主义巨型企业购买这种转基因种子和配套的特制肥料和农药。所以很明显，在这里，新乔特达尔也同样在这个帝国主义加强渗透的进程扮演着中间人的角色。这些中间人之所以对帝国主义有益，是因为后者可以利用这样的代理人剥夺小农的土地从而开设大型农业公司。在这里，我们可以很清楚地看见帝国主义，邦政府和新乔特达尔形成的联盟。Mamata（草根国大党头目，西孟邦首席部长，2011年执政至今——译者注）目前下了一道对这些有害种子的禁令。但还这并不是订单农业中正规的禁令。当然有着极大可能的是，这道禁令的合法化进程也将会像所谓的公私合作模式一样，变成Mamata新的鬼话。</p>
<h3 id="LAND-ACQUISITION-׃"><a href="#LAND-ACQUISITION-׃" class="headerlink" title="LAND ACQUISITION ׃"></a>LAND ACQUISITION ׃</h3><h3 id="土地征用："><a href="#土地征用：" class="headerlink" title="土地征用："></a>土地征用：</h3><p>The collusion of imperialism, state and neo-jotedars had become most evident at Singur-Nandigram and whenever imperialists and their compradors have acquired or tried to acquire land. Jotedars and neo-jotedars have surrendered their land first and earned a big sum of money because they possess a big amount of village land. For land plunder by big companies, the neo-jotedars have formed cooperatives, syndicates and a strong army of goons everywhere. The local unemployed youths have been utilized specially for this purpose. They are earning fat sums of money as commission from the capitalists. After land acquisition, they have got construction material, soil, labor supply contracts for construction of housing, hotels, shopping malls, modern brothels etc. In the anti-land acquisition struggle, therefore, neo-jotedars are the first enemy defense line before the struggling masses. In this land looting activity, in general, CPM-TMC has worked in collusion. A few words must be said, in this regard, about the large scale land-dacoity at Rajarhat.</p>
<p>帝国主义，国家和新乔特达尔的勾结已经在辛古尔-兰迪格兰事件（2006年，印共马党徒为了在这两个地区建立工业园区和警察对反对的群众进行了血腥镇压并造成重大伤亡。2009年又有对抗事件发生。最后还是因群众的激烈反抗而告吹——译者注）或者说每当帝国主义和买办需要获得土地时表现得极为露骨。乔特达尔和新乔特达尔率先交出了他们的土地并因他们本身就占有了大量农村土地而获利颇丰。为了替大企业掠夺土地，新乔特达尔建立起了合作社，财团和一支无处不在的强大匪军。本地的无业青年就因此有了特殊用途（即被雇作打手——译者注）。他们（新乔特达尔）从资本家手上拿到了算是手续费的一大笔钱。在征地之后，他们就拿到了建筑材料，土地，关于住宅、旅馆、购物中心、现代妓院等的建筑施工劳务承包合同。因此，在反征地斗争中，新乔特达尔就是抗争群众面前第一道敌人的防线。在这种征地运动中，印共马和草根国大党大体而言是沆瀣一气的。关于这点，不得不提的就是发生在拉瓦哈特的大规模征地运动。</p>
<p>As compared to Singur-Nandigram issue there was very little furor around Rajarhat, despite the fact that, it was like stealing the whole sea in a very subtle and silent manner. But why? Let us turn a bit towards history. Left front government resolved to build up New Kolkata at Rajarhat in 1993. Out of 40 mouzas 35 were swallowed by the rich people who infested new city at the heart of Rajarhat. No one thought of the poor peasants, of the loss of paddy production to the tune of 5.5 lakh maunds per year, of the loss of supply of green vegetables, fish etc. to Kolkata and outside, of hampering food security etc. On the contrary, in the inaugural programme of Rajarhat New Town Pranab Mukherjee and Ajit Panja (co founder of TMC) highly appreciated left front’s city plan.</p>
<p>和辛古尔-兰迪格兰事件相比，在拉瓦哈特似乎看不见多少人民的怒火，尽管事实上，在这里发生的是隐秘而微妙的瞒天过海般的盗窃行为。为什么会这样呢？让我们稍微回顾一下历史。1993年，左翼阵线政府决心在拉瓦哈特建设一个新加尔各答。40个莫扎（mouza，印度的一种特殊行政区划，相当于行政村，该称呼现已废止，由gram取代——译者注）中有35个被富人侵吞以图在加尔各答的心腹地带建立新城市。没人考虑过贫农，考虑过水稻产量每年达55万莫恩德（印度重量单位，1莫恩德折合82.28磅——译者注）的下降，考虑过绿色蔬菜和鱼等对加尔各答和外地供应的下降，考虑过这将会对粮食安全做出怎样的危害等等。恰恰相反，在拉瓦哈特新城区的开幕仪式当中， Pranab Mukherjee和Ajit Panja （草根国大党的共同创立人)还对左翼阵线的城市规划方案大加赞赏。</p>
<p>While TMC took CPM so strongly on to challenge in Singur and Nandigram, why did they remain passive at Rajarhat ? Why Mamata made a drama of presenting a large number of files in a mass meeting at Rajarhat but did not actually expose the corruption of the CPM leaders there which she claimed, is recorded in those files? There is only one answer: At Rajarhat TMC-brand neo-jotedars and their CPM counterpart had entered into a kind of cease-fire at the very outset and that too for the sake of making profit through sucking the blood of the poor people. It is as clear as day light, thanks to the united front of Gaffar-Kalo Babu-Arabul clique.</p>
<p>虽然草根国大党在辛古尔和兰迪格兰对印共马攻击的那样起劲，但为什么他们不把这份热忱留着用在拉瓦哈特呢？为什么Mamata在一次拉瓦哈特的大会上演的一出好戏中所展示了的一大堆文件里，实际上并没有披露出如同她所声称的印共马头目贪污的证据呢？（小骂大帮忙啊——译者注）对此唯有一个解释：在拉瓦哈特，打着草根国大党招牌的新乔特达尔和他们的印共马同行，从一开始就关于从穷人身上吸血谋取利润的共同目的达成了某种意义上的停战协议。归功于Gaffar-Kalo Babu-Arabul集团的统一战线，这一事实如今昭然若揭。</p>

They can quite easily get such jobs by bribing their high contacts or family relations. Caste factor plays here a great role.) All project funds invariably leak out to them. In our country, after the second generation reforms, government has declared 19 projects for poverty-alleviation through employment-generation. Majority of the poor people have heard of only 4-5 projects. Funds on these projects are sucked midway by the party offices before they can reach the poor people. The decisions regarding the formation of self-help groups and their formal registration are taken by the ruling party. Poor people cannot retain the job cards with themselves. They are with party offices or panchayats. How many people have so far got compensation for not getting 100 days work round the year? This money also outflows to party leaders. They plunder money through controlling school committees.<br>任何村务委员会里政府批准的资金（本质上还是人民的血汗钱）总是由在其中身担要职和处在核心地位的新乔特达尔所管控（他们的家庭成员至少一个会是政府雇员或是学校老师。他们可以凭借他们的紧密联系和亲族关系行贿从而很轻易地得到这些职位。种姓制于此发挥了巨大作用）。所有的项目资金对他们始终都是触手可及的。在我邦，在第二代改革之后，政府已经宣布过了19个旨在增加就业的扶贫项目。但大部分的穷人都只听说过其中的4-5个项目。这些项目的资金在到达穷人面前就已经被各级党委半路层层盘剥殆尽。而是否能建立正式登记的自助小组（即让穷人得到项目许诺的工作——译者注），都是要由执政党来决定的。穷人自己是不能保留工作卡的。只有党委和村务委员会才能保留工作卡。有多少在一年中有100天找不到工作的人能为此得到失业补助呢？这些钱也流进了党的领袖的荷包。他们还通过控制学校委员会的方式来贪污资金。</p>
<p>At the heart of CPM-TMC clashes lies the contradiction among the two sides of neo-jotedars for establishing command over people’s wealth. They also control the process of distribution of this money. They control this huge money not only for economic gains; a political goal is also involved here. Neo-jotedars use a part of this money for purchasing a section of people to build their own mass base and also to form their private army of goons. Using this economic power they try to create contradictions among the masses and to make sure that these contradictions remain alive always. One important source of their income is ration dealership which they use to sell people’s food in the open market at high prices and thus earn quite a big sum of money. Now a days, those who live in two storied buildings are given BPL cards while those who live in mud houses in a precarious condition are given APL cards. One thing is clear as day light- one important aspect of people’s struggle against these neo-jotedars is this all-out plundering of people’s wealth.</p>
<p>印共马-草根国大党之间的冲突实际上反映的就是两端新乔特达尔在建立侵吞人民财富的司令部时分赃不匀而产生的激烈矛盾。他们同样控制了资金的分配过程。他们控制了这样巨大的资金，并不仅仅是为了实现经济目的；政治目的也同样在内。新乔特达尔会拿出一部分钱来收买部分人民以作他们的群众基础，同时也旨在建立属于他们的私人匪军。运用着这种经济权力，他们尽可能地制造群众之间的矛盾，并企图让这种矛盾长期地保持下去。他们收入的一个重要来源就是在开放市场中投机倒把，将平价粮食转手倒卖到公开市场上并因此大发横财。现在，那些住在两层小楼的人拿着的是在贫困线以下的证明，而那些住在土屋中难以温饱的人却拿的是在贫困线之上的证明。一切都清清楚楚——人民斗争中的一个重要组成部分，就是要与新乔特达尔这种彻头彻尾的劫掠行径作斗争。</p>
<h3 id="USE-OF-SURPLUS-׃"><a href="#USE-OF-SURPLUS-׃" class="headerlink" title="USE OF SURPLUS ׃"></a>USE OF SURPLUS ׃</h3><h3 id="剥削所得的用途："><a href="#剥削所得的用途：" class="headerlink" title="剥削所得的用途："></a>剥削所得的用途：</h3><p>Prior to 2000 agricultural production in our State increased to some extent-to which big landowners contributed very little. Mainly middle landowners contributed to it, taking the help of irrigational facilities (boro cultivation). (Manabendu Chatterjee and Atanu Sengupta). These middle level landowners are mainly rich peasants of our State. Big landowners (jotedars) contribution to this increase is very little. Because they do not physically participate in production and they are not bothered about the technique of production. We can clearly see the feudal nature of this neo-jotedar class, developed through imperialist and state patronage, from their method of using this surplus. While rich peasants’ labor themselves, they use also labor of others – try to earn more profit by using cost-effective and developed techniques.</p>
<p>在2000年以前，我邦的农业产量有了一定程度的增长，大地主对此的贡献极其微小。为此做出贡献的主要是采用了新灌溉设施（波洛米种植）的中地主。（Manabendu Chatterjee 和Atanu Sengupta）这些中地主主要是我邦的富农。大地主（乔特达尔）之所以对这些增长贡献甚微，是因为他们不用亲身参与劳作，也对生产技术不感兴趣。我们可以从新乔特达尔阶级利用剥削所得的方式中很清楚地看出他们的封建本质在帝国主义和邦的庇护之下的发展。当富农亲自劳动的时候，他们也利用他人的劳动——尝试去运用低成本高效益的先进技术以赚取更多利润。<br>They reinvest this surplus for furtherance and development of production. But neo-jotedars do not do this. They invest their surplus in money lending business, brick field trade, transport business, sending their children to high standard city schools or colleges, construction business, grain trade and hoarding and increasing their periphery of political influence ( purchasing a section of masses, maintaining loyal goons, contesting election etc.) So they use their surplus to maintain and enlarge the scope of extra economic exploitation at a higher level. As a result, agriculture does not develop- it remains in a morass. Because of this reason, agricultural productivity is showing a falling trend during the last few years. So it can be said that this neo-jotedar class is mainly a feudal class and the capitalist character developed within them is of comprador and bureaucratic nature.<br>他们将这些所得的利润用于对扩大和发展生产的再投资。但新乔特达尔不会这样做。他们将剥削所得投资于借贷行业，砖瓦生意，运输行业，让他们子女去大城市接受高水准的教育，建筑行业，谷物贸易，巩固并提升自己的政治影响外延（收买部分群众，豢养忠实走狗，贿选等等）。因此他们运用剥削所得以维持并扩大超经济剥削的范围到一个更高的水平。正因为如此，农业生产率在过去几年都呈现着下降的趋势。因此我们可以说，新乔特达尔阶级主要是一个封建的阶级，而在他们之中发展的资本主义的性质是买办主义和官僚主义。</p>
<h3 id="CONTROL-OVER-MARKETS-׃"><a href="#CONTROL-OVER-MARKETS-׃" class="headerlink" title="CONTROL OVER MARKETS ׃"></a>CONTROL OVER MARKETS ׃</h3><h3 id="对市场的控制："><a href="#对市场的控制：" class="headerlink" title="对市场的控制："></a>对市场的控制：</h3><p>Neo-jotedars control simultaneously the land lease market, credit market and labor market. They are the common presence as land-leaser (i.e. leasing out land to share croppers) in the land market, labor-employer in the labor market and credit-supplier in the credit market. The rural poor find the same neo-jotedars in all three markets. As all three markets are interlocked, the jotedars have tremendously increased the scope for surplus extraction. The other side of the coin is that this interlocking increases the degree of exploitation of landless, poor and middle peasants a lot. With these three markets has been added another market- the market of agricultural inputs and output. Here also neo-jotedars are present as seller and buyer and with political power in hand they can impose their terms on peasants. By virtue of this interlocking of different markets the neo-jotedars are able to increase their surplus manifold than their older counterparts were able to do. Here again feudal essence is working under capitalist phenomena.<br>新乔特达尔同时控制了土地租赁市场，信贷市场和劳动市场。他们是土地市场的借地人（也就说是向佃农出租土地的家伙），劳动市场的雇主，信贷市场的放债人。农村穷人在这三个市场都会看到同样的一批新乔特达尔。另外一方面，这种犬牙交错的联合极大地提高了对失地农民、贫农、中农的剥削程度。这三个市场已经结合成了另外一个市场——农业投入品和农产品市场。在这里，新乔特达尔以买家和卖家的身份同时出现，掌握政权的他们可以对农民强加条款。从这三个不同市场的联合得到好处的新乔特达尔远比他们的旧同行更能提高他们剥削手段的多样性。在这里，资本主义的现象下，运作的是封建主义的实质。</p>
<p>From the foregone discussion, we can draw the following three conclusions׃<br>基于以上讨论，我们可以得出以下三个结论：</p>
<p>Capitalism is developing in agriculture but not at the cost of caste-feudalism. Capitalism is helping towards the survival of semi-feudalism in newer forms. Feudal production relations are remaining intertwined with the capitalist ones and working even in the very process of capitalist surplus value extraction. The class of neo-jotedars are extracting surplus through their political power, monopolistic control over land and other agricultural inputs and by using the prevalent caste system. The ultimate outcome is that this capitalism is, by nature, feudal.</p>
<p>资本主义的确是正在农业中发展，但不是以种姓-封建制的消亡为基础。资本主义正在帮助半封建制度转化为新形式以维持其存在。封建的生产关系被保留并和资本主义的生产关系交织在一起，甚至在资本主义的剩余价值生产过程中也发挥作用。新乔特达尔阶级通过对他们的政治权力的运用，对土地和其他农业投入品的垄断式控制，和对普遍存在的种姓制度的利用进行剥削。最终的结论就是，这种资本主义的本质是封建主义的。</p>
<p>Capitalism has developed in our State in the interest of imperialism and under its active guidance and control. So its development is not uninterrupted, but controlled and subordinated. Neo-jotedars are acting as a medium of penetration of imperialist capital in agriculture and imperialists have created this class for this purpose. The old jotedars were failing in this respect. People’s struggle ended their regime and in this backdrop, imperialism came forward with their green revolution and controlled and limited land reform program. They degenerated a section (mainly from OBC and advanced dalit castes) who took part in the anti-feudal struggle. This section was transformed into their more dynamic agents. As a result, the capitalist nature of the neo-jotedars is of comprador type.</p>
<p>我邦资本主义的发展是服务于帝国主义的利益并服从于它的积极诱导和控制之下的。因此，它的发展并不是不受干预的，而是被控制的且是附庸性的。帝国主义为了让其资本得以渗透农业，便创造了履行如此职能的新乔特达尔这一媒介。旧乔特达尔在这方面就被抛弃了。人民的斗争终结了他们的统治，而在这种背景下，帝国主义和他们（新乔特达尔）的绿色革命和那有限的土地改革议程降临了。他们成为了反封建斗争中的一个腐化部分。而这个部分转化成了帝国主义更加精力充沛的代理人。正因为如此，新乔特达尔的资本主义性质是买办主义。</p>
<p>State as an agent of imperialism has exclusively backed this class. Starting from bank loan up to government funds- all accrue to them. As they are at the top of the party and panchayat, they can use this power to plunder government funds and exploit peasants. They are also at the higher level of state administrative hierarchy. They are not an independent capitalist class who emerged through competition. So, their capitalist character is of monopolistic and bureaucratic nature. Generally speaking, from eighties onwards, a particular kind of capitalism started developing in the rural areas of Bengal. This kind of capitalism is developed under the guidance of imperialism, based on feudalism and backed by the state. So the very nature of this capitalism is feudal, comprador and bureaucratic. This capitalism on the one hand removes the old forms of semi-feudalism and on the other hand renovates them. The ultimate outcome is the emergence of a new type of (bureaucratic capitalist) jotedar class. Today, when imperialism is penetrating more deeply into our agricultural sector, this class is acting as a tool in its hand.</p>
<p>邦政府作为帝国主义的代理人也大力支持这一阶级，从银行贷款到政府资金都一一倾囊相助。当他们成为了党和村务委员会的顶层之时，他们就可以运用权力来吞并政府资金并剥削农民了。他们同样位于整个邦的行政层次结构的较高层次。他们不是一个在独立自主的资本主义的竞争中出现的阶级。因此他们的资本主义特征本质上是垄断且官僚主义的。一般来说，从八十年代起，一种特殊类型的资本主义就在西孟加拉邦的农村地区开始发展了。这种资本主义的发展是基于封建制度之上而在帝国主义的管控之下，且受到邦政府支持的。因此，这种资本主义的本质是封建的，买办的和官僚主义的。这种资本主义在一方面移除了部分半封建制度的旧形式，而在另外一方面又对它们加以翻新。最终的结果就是，一种新类型的（官僚资本主义）乔特达尔阶级的诞生。在今日，这个阶级正在充当着帝国主义日益渗透我邦的农业部门的工具。</p>

As compared to traditional exploiters whose sources of exploitation were mainly land, money lending and crop trade. The thing is not so simple and open for the neo-jotedars. In many a cases, they do not own much land and land is not also their main source of exploitation. So when economists, while classifying rural population on the basis of the amount of land owned, very often, make the mistake of including neo-jotedars in the category of middle peasants or even rural unemployed people.</p>
<p>我们在先前已经认识到了新乔特达尔阶级有着多种剥削之源和剥削方式。与传统的主要以土地，借贷，和谷物贸易为剥削手段的剥削者相比，新乔特达尔（的剥削手段）并不如此简单而开诚布公。在很多情况下，他们并没有拥有多少土地，土地也并非他们的主要剥削手段。因此当经济学家以土地拥有数额为基础来归类农村人口时，他们时常会犯下将新乔特达尔归类到中农甚至是农村失业人口的错误。</p>
<p>One report (Sudipta Bhattacharya) shows that rural households owning land up to 7.5 bighas, own 63% of the assets other than land and 49% of loans taken from banks and other institutions. This amounts to the fact that a section of these middle sized owners are, in fact, well-to-do. In order to sustain the multiple sources of exploitation by the neo-jotedars a complex and all embracing political structure has been built up. To initiate and sustain anti semi-feudal struggle in this State, it is imperative on our part to comprehend this political structure. During the period of old jotedars, political power was in the hand of big jotedars, money lenders and traders combine. They were the controller of socio-economic-political and cultural life in the rural areas.</p>
<p>一则报告（Sudipta Bhattacharya）显示，农村家庭土地拥有量上升至7.5比加（比加是尼泊尔、孟加拉和部分印度邦用的土地计量单位，在尼泊尔，1比加约合2603.7平方米——译者注），除了自己的土地之外还拥有63%的资产，背负有49%的从银行或是其他机构的贷款。这个数据揭露了这样的一个事实：这些中型的拥有者实际上很富裕。为了维护新乔特达尔多重的剥削手段，一个复杂而无所不括的政治结构已然建立。为了发起并贯彻在这个邦的反封建斗争，我们必须理解这种政治结构。在旧乔特达尔统治时期，政权由大乔特达尔，放债人和商人联盟共享。他们是农村地区社会-经济-政治乃至文化生活的支配者。</p>
<p>Central state power used to exercise its authority through this class. These areas were somewhat like sovereign republics. Social polarization and class contradiction were intense and these enemies were very easily identifiable. People could be quite rapidly mobilized against their political and economic authority in the field of class struggle. Panchayat was a non-entity and jotedars themselves were ruling party heads in the locality. There was no party structure also. Things started changing since eighties. Now a day we see that neo-jotedars do not rule directly. They rule through party and panchayats. Their domination over these institutions is the source of their power. In the rural areas they have formed a complex clique of party-panchayat-administration and police which again is led by the party. These neo-jotedars are at the top of all these institutions and this is the source of their power.</p>
<p>邦政府中央权力过去常常通过这个阶级行使它的权威。这些地区就像是主权共和国一般。社会两极的极度分化和阶级矛盾的极度尖锐化让这些敌人显而易见。人民可以被很快地动员起来，在阶级斗争的领域里和他们的政治权能和经济权能所抗衡。在那时，村务委员会形同虚设，乔特达尔本身就是当地执政党的首脑。然而自八十年代起事情就起了变化。现在我们可以看到新乔特达尔并不直接进行统治。他们通过党和村务委员会进行统治。他们通过这些机构执行的支配就是他们力量的源泉。在农村地区，他们已经建立起了一个复杂的由党-村务委员会-行政体系和同样由党所领导的警察所构成的团伙。这些新乔特达尔是所有这些机构的顶层，而这些机构就是他们权力的源泉。</p>
<p>Using this power they control every aspects of economic, political and social life of the rural areas. It appears outwardly that feudal style individual rule of the king or zamindars have been replaced by capitalist style rule of elected institutions, political parties and centralized state institutions. But, we have to keep in mind that none of these institutions are supra-class institutions. All these are controlled by the neo-jotedar class and through this control they exercise their political rule in rural areas. In essence, the apparent capitalistic power structure is aimed at surviving the rural feudal authority. So we should keep in mind that our conclusions should be based on the analysis of the essence of the thing.</p>
<p>他们运用这种权力控制了农村地区经济，政治和社会生活的方方面面。很明显，以往的封建式的由国王或是柴明达尔实行的个人统治已经被资本主义式的选举机构，政党和中央邦政府机关所取代了。但是，我们必须牢记的是，所有的这些机构，没有一个是超阶级的存在。它们都由新乔特达尔阶级控制，而后者凭借着这种控制在农村地区行使他们的政治统治。这些看似资本主义式的权力结构本质上还是旨在延续农村的封建权力。所以我们也应牢记，我们的结论应该建立在对事物本质的分析之上。</p>
<p>Though panchayats were formed in the name of the decentralization of power, they have, at the one end, extended the central state control to the grass root level (the side effect being, a kind of self rule illusion among the people). On the other end, through their control on these institutions, the neo-jotedars established their command over huge amount of state funds and also over the area. A report of state government shows that the percentage of jotedars, traders, school teacher and service men among the panchayat members is on an increase. Even 30 to 40 percent are from unemployed and from those engaged in social service oriented activities. Actually majority of these are the party big guns. Though they own very little or almost no land, they control rural co-ops, school committees etc. They are in the charge or allocation of government fund. They capture government contracts and engage themselves in various businesses. They have, thus, amassed huge wealth (recorded or unrecorded). 60 percent among panchayat members are from such people who are not agriculturists. So we should not identify the rural rulers on the basis of the amount of land owned alone. We have to take into account the whole perspective of rural economic and political control and power. Party leads the other pillars of local power structure.</p>
<p>尽管村务委员会是以去权力集中化的名义建立起来的，但一方面，它们加强了邦政府中央对基层层次的掌控（副作用是给人们制造了一种自治的错觉）；另一方面，通过对这些机构的控制，新乔特达尔在邦政府和各地都建立起了自己的司令部。一则政府报告指出，村务委员会中乔特达尔，商人，学校老师和军人的占比正在上升。甚至有30%到40%的成员是无业者或是那些投身于社会服务的人。这些人中的大多数实际上都是党的大佬。尽管他们拥有的土地极少甚至近于没有，他们控制了农村合作社和学习委员会等等。他们掌管着政府资金的分配。他们拿到政府合同并参与到各行各业，并为此大发横财（记录在案的或者未记录的）。60%的村务委员会成员都来自这样不事农业的人群。所以我们不应单单以土地拥有量来判断农村统治者。我们必须要考虑到整个农村经济和政治的控制和权力的方方面面。党领导着其他地方权力结构的支柱。</p>
<p>So we need to probe deeply into the role of party. Old jotedars’ party, Congress, did not have the octopus like party and mass organization network with branches and sub branches spread up to the grass root level (later, Congress and TMC learnt the organization building technique from CPM).</p>
<p>因此我们需要深入地探究党的角色。旧乔特达尔的党即国大党过去并没有像是这样从基层层次扩张的既有主干又有分支的繁密的党和群众网络（当然随后，国大党和草根国大党就从印共马身上学会了这种组织建设技术）。</p>
<p>1.In our State, the ruling class had an additional advantage of getting a revisionist party like CPM for use close at hand. After coming to power in 1977, CPM used government power to build a vast party-mass organization network. CPM leaders themselves either degenerated into neo-jotedars or their agents. A sizable section of old jotedars changed their color and joined CPM. There are sharp contradictions among the neo-jotedars around government funds, contracts, control over co-ops and share over the proceeds of exploitation. In the past, when there was no opposition as such, these contradictions come out in the form of rivalry among two factions of CPM. Later, a big section of the neo-jotedars organized themselves under the banner of TMC. In most areas, the two rival groups peacefully shared among themselves the fruit of exploitation. The areas where CPM liquidated all opposition are now going for a trend-reversal – opposition party is now up with arms to wipe out CPM. Though TMC does not yet have an organized party structure like CPM, they are now forming armed gangs of goons in the rural areas. However, one thing can be said for sure, intra-class contradiction of rulers in rural Bengal is much sharper than in other States. Revolutionaries can utilize this contradiction.</p>
<p>1.在我邦，统治阶级有着一个额外的优势，就是可以随时利用像是印共马这样一个修正主义的党。在1977掌权之后，印共马利用政府职权建设了一个庞大的党-群众组织网络。印共马的头目要么堕落成了新乔特达尔，要么就成为了它的代理人。相当部分的旧乔特达尔改头换面，加入了印共马。在新乔特达尔内部，关于政府资金，合同，合作社的主管权和剥削所得的分成等问题，他们之间有着尖锐的矛盾。在过去，在还不至于出现这样的异议时（还没夺取政权——译者注），这些矛盾以印共马两派内斗的形式表现出来。不久之后，一大批的新乔特达尔在草根国大党的旗帜下组织了起来。在大多数地区，这两个竞争集团和睦地分享他们剥削而来的果实。而那些印共马曾经消灭过所有反对党的地方，现在却走向了一个彻底的反转——反对党现在为了推翻印共马武装起来了。尽管没有印共马那样严密的党组织，草根国大党也在农村地区建立起了一支持械匪帮。然而，可以确认的是，在西孟加拉邦的农村地区的统治阶级的内部矛盾远比其他邦的要更尖锐。革命者应当利用这种矛盾。</p>
<p>2.The goons (armed mainly with traditional arms, lethal bahini) of old jotedars are being replaced by the organized party cadres (armed with sophisticated arms) cum lumpen force. Our State is well ahead of other States in this respect also. Ruling parties have used official reliefs to degenerate a section of the toiling masses into their cadres or goons or lackeys. These party cadres are much more organized with huge amount of modern weapons. We saw in the past how in Rajarhat the CPM and TMC armed goons had beaten, intimidated and evicted poor people in village after village and that too, to serve the interest of the big capital. However, in Singur and Nandigram, when they took on the same course of action, they were kicked out by the struggling masses. In any area, if the revolutionaries are not adequately prepared to counter this well organized armed party cadre force, they will have to suffer huge setback.</p>
<p>2.旧乔特达尔的打手（主要是由传统装备武装的民团， lethal bahini）正在由训练有素的党干部（配备有精良的装备）和无业游民组成的武装所取代。我邦在这方面也领先于其他诸邦。执政党已经利用官方的救济资金收买了一部分的劳苦大众加入到他们的干部或打手或仆从的行列中去。这些党干部更加训练有素，也持有大量的现代武器。我们过去已经在拉瓦哈特见识过了印共马和草根国大党的武装匪帮是如何为了垄断资本服务，一个村落一个村落地去恐吓、残虐乃至屠杀穷苦人民的。然而，在辛古尔和兰迪格兰，当他们想要故技重施的时候，他们就给抗争群众狠狠地揍了出去。无论在何处，都请革命者务必为应对这些组织严密的党干部武装做出精心准备，以免为此受到巨大的挫折。</p>
<p>3.These party leaders decide on what portion of government funds will be spent and in which areas, who will be given loans and even which part of the village and in front of whose house tube wells will be erected. Through this they create their social base among poor people. They use this social base to quell any protest move against them. They send a section of the people to fight against another section. They establish their control over the area in this way. This is why we see that masses here, instead of struggling on the basis of class, are more divided on party line and up against each other. So we now see, after the change of power, that TMC led pattadars is up in arms to evict CPM led pattadars. In the past, anti feudal class struggle was organized directly against the authority of big jotedars. Though the big jotedars were backed by Congress party, yet the struggle, at the very outset, did not take congress versus people form. Class nature of the struggle was relatively open and direct: Feudalism versus poor people. Conversely, today the neo-jotedars themselves are party leaders in most cases.</p>
<p>3.这些党的头目决定了政府资金的哪一部分将被使用，哪些地区可以得到这笔贷款，甚至哪些村子以及在这些村子里的哪些人家的管井最先开通。通过这样的方式他们在穷人之中建立了他们的社会基础。他们利用这种社会基础来镇压任何反抗他们的运动。他们挑拨群众斗群众。他们就是通过这种方式建立了全方位的统治。因此我们现在可以看到，在政权更替之后，由草根国大党所领导的帕塔达尔（pattadar，即在土改后获得土地的原佃农，相当于中农。也就是前文提到的被收买的群众，所谓“土地证的奴隶”——译者注）就武装起来驱逐由印共马所领导的帕塔达尔了。在过去，反封建阶级的斗争是被直接组织起来以对抗大乔特达尔的权威的。尽管大乔特达尔有着国大党作后盾，然而这场斗争在一开始也并没有表现为“国大党vs人民”的形式。这场斗争的阶级本质十分明确：“封建主义vs穷苦人民”。与此相反的是，在今日，大多数情况下许多新乔特达尔自己就是党的头目。</p>
<p>So anti feudal struggle is taking the form of ruling party versus people at the very inception itself. The struggle is more complex because the entire ruling party cannot be physically liquidated. More so because in the ruling party, there are poor people also, winning them over to our side is an agendum of the revolutionary class struggle. With the changes in the situation we have to realize this new form of class struggle in the rural areas. Revolutionaries should take up the difficult task of uniting people on the basis of class and of dismantling the social base of ruling parties through class struggle. During the last 34 years rule, in many incidents, CPM had mobilized a section of masses to suppress revolutionaries (now TMC is doing the same thing). Today, fascist method of creating mass base and using it to serve the interest of the ruling class and party has now become an inseparable part of the ruling party operation.</p>
<p>因此，反封建斗争其本身正在表现为“执政党vs人民”的形式。这场斗争变得更加复杂，因为整个执政党是不可能在物质上被摧毁的。这也更因为在执政党内同样有着穷苦人民，而将他们争取到我们的一侧，是革命阶级的斗争中必不可少的议程之一。这些情况的变化让我们必须意识到农村地区中阶级斗争的新形式。革命者应当肩负通过阶级斗争的方式以阶级基础团结人民和摧毁执政党社会基础的艰巨使命。在过去34年的执政期内，印共马已经动员起了一部分的群众来镇压革命者（现在的草根国大党也是这样做的）。如今，对为统治阶级和执政党利益服务的法西斯式的制造群众基础的方法的运用已经成了执政党统治手段必不可少的组成部分。</p>
<p>4.Apart from building and using mass base, ruling parties also create and intensify contradictions among the masses and use the backward sections of them. During their regime, CPM mobilized local peasants of Haringhata to beat the retail traders, involved in an anti Reliance movement. Now, TMC is also doing the same thing. During CPM rule, many pattadars were deprived of pattas of their land. CPM leaders even forcefully grabbed the allotted land from legal pattadars and handed it over to their loyalists. Now, TMC is indulging in a kind of agreement between old jotedars and deprived pattadars that the latter will be given some portion of land after the former get their ‘due’ if the latter can evict CPM-led pattadars.</p>
<p>4.除了建立和利用群众基础之外，执政党同样制造和激化了群众内部的矛盾，并对落后部分的群众加以利用。在统治期间，印共马发动了Haringhata当地的农民以打击零售商，参与了一场反对Reliance集团的运动。现在，草根国大党也做着一样的事。在印共马政权期间，许多帕塔达尔的土地的帕塔（土地证）被夺走了。印共马的头头甚至诉诸武力夺走了帕塔达尔依法分配到的土地并把它们分给了他们的走狗们。如今，草根国大党正热衷于和旧乔特达尔和贫困的帕特达尔签订一种如果他们驱逐了由印共马所领导的帕特达尔之后就可以得到一部分土地作为“回报”的协议。</p>
<p>5.The main task of the ruling parties and their mass organizations is to act as the extended hand of the state. This party structure tries to suppress every form of people’s struggle prior to or at the time of direct state intervention of state forces. For this reason, the primary onslaught on the student’s movements come from the side of SFI; CITU plays the same role in the working class movement, peasants’ organization in the peasant movement and co-ordination committee in the employee’s moves. Now, TMC mass wings are preparing to take the same role. This party network also work as eyes and ears of the state machinery. They maintain strict surveillance on every one of the locality and report back in a time bound manner to the police. Special responsibility is given to some cadres for maintaining regular contact with the police and administration. So the revolutionaries also should build their organization so that these eyes and ears can be evaded.</p>
<p>5.执政党和它们的群众组织的主要任务就是扮演邦政府的触手。这个党的结构力图在引来邦政府军队执行直接的邦级干预之前镇压方方面面的人民斗争。正因为如此，主要负责镇压学生运动是印度学联（印共马的外围学生组织）；印度工会中心（印共马外围的工会组织）也在工人运动，农民运动的农民组织和雇员运动的协调委员会中扮演着相同的角色。现在，草根国大党的群众爪牙也准备要扮演同样的角色了。这个党的网络同样充当着国家机器的耳目。他们对每一个人的忠诚度都保持着严格的监视，并会在规定时限内向警察报道。为了维持和警察及行政体系的联系，一些干部被赋予了特殊的职权。因此革命者也同样应该建立起自己的组织来规避这些耳目的监视。</p>
<p>6.This octopus like party organization controls every aspects of people’s life. Be it social, cultural and family centric. It has created a suffocating atmosphere in the rural areas. Party and panchayat offices are like the court house of old jotedars. Starting from rural arbitration to family feuds to social, cultural and religious contradictions, party pokes its nose into everything. To resolve these issues minus party is treated as a rebellion against party. The things which didn’t even concern the old jotedars have now come under the scanner of the party. Parties extends its mass base through these activities and also make sure so that the contradictions among the masses survive. Party maintains its tight control on temple – mosque director boards, youth clubs, school committees, trader’s associations etc. At times, they enter into armed conflict to resolve the issue of controlling these social organizations.</p>
<p>6.党的附庸组织控制了人民生活的方方面面，成了社会、文化和家庭的中心。它在农村地区制造了一种令人窒息的氛围。党支部和村委会的办公室就像是旧乔特达尔的公堂。从对农村调解到家庭纠纷再到社会、文化和宗教矛盾，党都要横插一脚。不通过党来解决这些纠纷，被视为是对党的反抗。就连那些旧乔特达尔完全不感兴趣的事情，如今也在党的监控之下。通过这些活动，党扩大了自己的群众基础，同时也确保了群众之间的矛盾长存。党维持着它对神庙-清真寺管理委员会、青年俱乐部、学校委员会和商会等社会团体的严密控制。有时，他们会挑起武装纷争以解决控制这些社会组织时出现的问题。</p>
<p>Party controls even the caste organizations also. One recent example is CPM – TMC struggle to be in an influential position in the leading body of Matua (Namashudra) community. (After TMC assumed office a new trend has started. In the past, the religious and caste organizations didn’t dare to intrude into political affairs. These leaders, instead, used to maintain their position through hobnobs with the powerful party leaders. But with the weakening of class struggle and left outlook, these leaders have started to intervene into political affairs, thanks to their pampering by the TMC (and also CPM) leaders Like Imams and Moulanas in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, Matua leaders are also giving Fatuas regarding which parties to be voted for. We have to be watchful over this dangerous trend.) In short, neo-jotedars have built up an all-engrossing power structure so that they can control all the social organizations to secure every source of exploitation and maintain political authority. People’s rebellion against CPM is, in essence, a rebellion against this structure. TMC is now trying to organize such a structure.</p>
<p>党甚至控制了种姓组织。最近的一个例子是：印共马-草根国大党之间的斗争对马图亚 （纳玛首陀罗）社团领导班子的组成具有决定性作用。（在国大党掌权之后有了一种新趋势。在过去，宗教组织和种姓组织根本不敢插手政治事务。这些组织的领袖过去常靠巴结当权的党的头目以维持自己的地位。但是在阶级斗争和左翼势力的减弱的情况下，这些领袖也渐渐开始干预政治事务，这是要归功于草根国大党（和印共马）的头目们的。像比哈尔邦和北方邦的阿訇和毛拉及马图亚社团的领袖会关于选举哪个政党给出法特瓦（教法新解）。我们必须要注意这个危险的趋势）总之，新乔特达尔已经建立起了一个全方位统治的权力结构以便控制这些社会组织从而保障所有的剥削之源并维系政权。人民对印共马的反抗实质上就是对这种结构的反抗。草根国大党现在就在努力组织起这样一个结构。</p>
<p>7.Party plays a big role in weakening the edge of the class struggle and damping it. They do it in various ways. By purchasing the struggling elements, intimidating them, bribing them in the form of concession, channelizing the contradictions into legal paths, creating family pressure or pressure on the family, imposing social boycott, entangling them into non-political cases and non-political issues, using police in the appropriate time, even physically annihilating most determined elements at the very inception of the movement. Party controls the relationship between people and administration in such a way that masses can never get the job done from police and administration. Only after getting the necessary permission and information from the concerned persons, police and administration will act in a specific manner. This complex interweaving network of party-panchayat-police-state administration is the local power structure of our rural areas. Through controlling this structure neo-jotedars run their rural regime.</p>
<p>7.党在模糊阶级斗争的边界和阻止它的进行中发挥了巨大作用。他们以很多种方式如此行事。通过收买斗争分子，恐吓他们，以让步的形式贿赂他们，将矛盾引导至合法道路，对其家人施压，施行社会抵制孤立他们，使他们被非政治性的问题所纠缠，在恰当的时机动用武力，甚至是在运动伊始就对最坚定的分子予以肉体消灭，党就是以这样永远不为人民服务的警察和行政体系控制人民和行政体系之间的关系。只有当有关人物的必要命令下达之时，警察和行政体系才会以特殊的方式活跃起来。这个复杂交错的党-村务委员会-邦行政体系网络就是我邦农村地区的当地权力结构。通过这种结构，新乔特达尔行使着他们在农村的统治。</p>
<p>8.The vast organization and mass base of the party is helping the ruling class to influence rural people’s opinion politically in their favor. So the revolutionaries have to battle politically at the grass root level against the ruling class influence. Political intervention has, therefore, become much more important than before.</p>
<p>8.广大的组织和群众基础正在让农村人民的政治观念为统治阶级所青睐的观点所影响。因此革命者必须要在基层层次和统治阶级的政治影响作政治工作的斗争。政治干预也因此比以往变得更加重要了。</p>
<p>Generally speaking, as opposed to the situation prevailing during old jotedars rule, today, imperialism has penetrated in the rural areas in a bigger way and alongside this, the central state machinery has extended its structure in the rural areas. Party and panchayats are its tools. If one sees it superficially, it may seem that feudalism has been removed through this process. But we should not forget that feudal classes-both old and new- are surviving because of imperialist back up and control. When because of people’s struggle semi feudalism in its old from cannot continue, imperialism makes sure that it can survive in its new and renovated form. The breakdown of the old form and survival through new form – through this ongoing transformation process imperialism deepened and extended its penetration in agricultural sector. Historically, when old feudalism in our country was on the verge of breakdown, the emerging new British rulers created a new landlord (zamindar) class as their agent through permanent settlement at the end of eighteenth and early nineteenth century period.</p>
<p>一般来说，和旧乔特达尔统治时期的盛行的情况正相反，如今帝国主义已经更深地渗透到了农村地区当中，同时中央国家机器也扩大了它在农村地区的结构。党和村务委员会是它们的工具。如果从表面上来看，似乎封建制度是已经在这个进程中被摧毁了。但我们不应忘记封建阶级——旧的和新的——都得益于帝国主义的支持和控制而依旧存在。当人民对半封建制度的斗争让它无法以旧形式维持的时候，帝国主义就确保其能以变革过的新形式延续。旧形式（的封建制度）的崩溃和新形式的延续——通过这个正在进行的转换过程，帝国主义加深并拓展了它在农业部门渗透的深度和广度。在历史上十八世纪末期至十九世纪早期的时期，当我国的陈旧的封建制度处于崩溃边缘的时候，新出现的英国统治者也是这样创造了一个新的地主（柴明达尔）阶级以充当他们永久定居的代理人。</p>
<p>Later, when people’s struggles called into question the existence of the zamindari system, absentee landlords were replaced by the class of village based exploiters (mainly erstwhile intermediaries), that is, jotedars. Even afterwards when the jotedari system was almost dismantled by the spring thunder of sixties and seventies, a section was chosen from among those who struggled against old jotedars and subsequently, this section was transformed into a neo-jotedar class. Taking the opportunities opened in every such crisis, imperialism and indigenous comprador capital have deepened their penetration in agriculture. This is obvious if anti feudal struggle does not culminate into seizure of political power (revolution) by the workers and peasants. So the main question is not whether the power of jotedars has increased or decreased. The relevant question is: in what form semi feudalism is existing. One point has to be borne in mind all the time: imperialism will never root out feudalism lock stock and barrel to pave the way for uninterrupted and free development of capitalism. Because, if it does so, it’s basic interest of extracting super profit through plundering of cheap labor and natural resources in semi colonial countries will be jeopardized.</p>
<p>随后，当人民的斗争质疑柴明达尔制度的存在之时，空出的地主位置就被基于农村的剥削者阶级（主要是先前的二地主）所占据了，那就是乔特达尔。甚至在乔特达尔制度也几乎为六十到七十年代的春雷所摧毁的时候，一部分为打倒旧乔特达尔而奋斗的人被选中了，而随后，这部分人就蜕变为了新乔特达尔阶级。公然地利用每一次这种危机带来的机遇，帝国主义和本地的买办资本以及加深了他们对农业的渗透。很明显，工农如果不掌握政权（革命成功），反封建斗争是不会结束的。因此主要问题不在于乔特达尔的权力是增加一点还是减少一点。关键问题是在于：半封建制度以什么样的形式存在。有一点我们应该始终牢记于心：帝国主义是永远不会从根本扫除封建制度的桎梏而为不受干扰的和自由发展的资本主义铺平道路的。因为，如果这么做，它通过在半封建国家得以掠夺廉价劳动力和自然资源而得来的超额利润的基本利益就会受到危害。</p>
<p>Conversely, it is not correct to think that feudalism has only one form – extraction of surplus from direct producers by the landlords through open application of brute force. As many intellectuals do actually think this way and so they conclude that big landlords are non-existent and, therefore, feudalism has been wiped away. CPM also propagates this viewpoint. They refuse to see the interrelation of imperialism and feudalism. So they are unable to realize that feudal production relation cannot be done away without overthrowing imperialism and semi colonial state.Consequently, they are unable to grasp the removal/renovation dialectics of semi feudalism. (For the very same reason, they ignore the comprador-bureaucratic nature of industry and service sector capitalism and take it as independent capitalism.) They are unable to understand that without struggling against the neo-jotedar class which has emerged with imperialist back up and control, no true anti-imperialist struggle can be possible. If we deny this responsibility, we have to confine ourselves to only anti imperialist propagandist type activities in the urban areas.</p>
<p>反过来说，认为封建制度只有一种形式—— 地主通过公开的诉诸武力来剥削直接生产者——也是不对的。许多学者却的确是这样想的，因此他们就得出了由于大乔特达尔不复存在因而封建制度也被摧毁的结论。印共马也大肆传播这一观点。他们拒绝去发现帝国主义和封建主义之间的相互联系。因此他们就不能意识到，封建的生产关系不可能在赶走帝国主义和推翻半殖民地国家之前就被摧毁。所以，他们不能掌握对半封建制度的去除/革新的辩证法。（基于同样的原因，他们无视在工业和服务业部门的买办-官僚主义的本质并把它当做独立自主的资本主义。）他们不能明白，不与伴随着帝国主义支持和操纵出现的新乔特达尔阶级斗争，就不可能有真正的反帝国主义斗争。如果我们否定这点，我们只能让自己局限在城市地区里做一点反帝国主义鼓吹家的工作了。</p>

A few questions: In quest of answer</h2><h2 id="3-一些问题：寻求答案"><a href="#3-一些问题：寻求答案" class="headerlink" title="3.一些问题：寻求答案"></a>3.一些问题：寻求答案</h2><p>Many intellectuals are categorizing this development of capitalism in rural areas as “distorted capitalism”. However, they are not identifying when and where capitalism was pure and undistorted. As capitalism is an anarchic system, it always leads to unplanned, head-heavy, one-sided and distorted development of productive forces.This is true even for capitalist-imperialist countries. Because of this distorted growth, the old (revisionist) form of Russian capitalism broke down (1991). Now we observe (in the capitalist-imperialist countries) unprecedented growth of financial sector and retreat of industrial sector. The main task is to determine the nature of capitalism in our country. These intellectuals either cannot see or intentionally hide the role of imperialism. Moreover, they are unable to see the interrelationship between this type of capitalism, feudalism and state. This is why they are unable to see the feudal, comprador and bureaucratic nature of our capitalism. These intellectuals confuse semi feudalism with feudalism. As soon as they do not observe the traditional features of feudalism, they conclude that feudalism is over.</p>
<p>许多学者将农村地区的建立起来的资本主义称作“受到阻碍的资本主义” 。然而，他们自己也分不清何时何地的资本主义是纯粹而又不受到阻碍的。因为资本主义是一种（经济上）无政府主义的体系，它总是要滑落到一个漫无计划，两极分化并阻碍生产力的发展的地步。这对资本主义-帝国主义国家也同样成立。正因为这种（对生产力的）反动，旧形式（修正主义）的俄国资本主义于1991年崩溃了。现在我们可以看到（在资本主义-帝国主义国家里）金融部门前所未有的增长和工业部门的倒退。我们的主要任务就是明确我国资本主义的性质。这些学者要么不能看出，要么就是故意隐藏了帝国主义在其中扮演的角色。其次，他们也没能看出这些类型的资本主义和封建主义与国家之间的相互关联。这就是为什么他们无法看出我国所谓资本主义中含有的封建主义，买办主义和官僚主义的性质。这些学者还将封建制和半封建制混淆了。只要看不见封建制度的“传统”特征，他们就会下结论说封建制度已经终结了。</p>
<p>Another important question is the question of laboring on land. Revolutionaries distinguish between jotedars and peasants on the basis of physical participation or the lack of it in cultivation. A jotedar is one who does not devote physical labor on land. But today, there are many among the neo-jotedars who work on land or used to work on land in the recent past or members of their families are still giving physical labor on land. (Generally speaking, the majority among the neo-jotedars who used to give labor on land in the past do not physically participate in cultivation any more at present.) Many of them have no land at all. Therefore, we should not dogmatically apply this criterion while going for class analysis in the rural areas. Though still the criterion of devoting labor on land is the main criterion of identification of jotedars, we have to take into account also the role played by them in the overall economic and political activities in the rural areas.</p>
<p>另外一个重要的问题是在土地上劳动的问题。革命者要在亲身参与的基础上或是以在种植过程中是否参与劳动为标准来区分乔特达尔和农民。一个乔特达尔是不需要在土地上付出任何体力劳动的。但在今日，许多原先就在土地上劳作的新乔特达尔和他们的家人或许还在土地上做体力劳动。（一般来说，大部分曾经在土地上耕作的新乔特达尔现在都不再亲自参与体力劳作了。）他们中的不少人也完全没有土地。因此，我们不应在农村地区进行阶级分析的时候武断地应有这种判断标准。尽管这个以是否在土地上劳作为基准的标准仍是判断乔特达尔的主要标准，我们也必须要考虑到他们在整个农村经济和政治活动中扮演的角色。</p>
<p>Particularly, we have to see whether they are exploiting the peasants in extra economic ways by using their social, political power. For this reason, those at the top of the political power ladder (particularly, the high party persons) should be treated mainly as neo-jotedars. When our cadres will go for class analysis in the rural areas they must bear this point in mind. They must distinguish between leaders and common cadres of the ruling parties and they must try to win the latter in our favor. Some intellectuals opine that cultivation is no longer profitable and therefore, peasants are not feeling attached to land any more. As a result of this lack of land hunger, they are not eager to launch land-seizure movement. So at the outset, there should be movement for decrease in input prices and remunerative output prices. In the process, when agriculture becomes profitable, they will start land-seizure movement. These intellectuals forget the experience of Singur and Nandigram movement in which the peasants sacrificed their life for a small piece of land. Moreover, these intellectuals concentrated only on rich and middle peasants. And that is why they measure the level of land hunger only in terms of the profitability of cultivation. But, at the same time, this is also true that during the last three decades there had been no mention- worthy land-seizure movement in our state.</p>
<p>特别要指出，我们必须看出他们是否动用他们的社会，政治权力以超经济方式剥削农民。因此，那些处在政权高层的权重者（特别是党的高层人物）主要应当视作新乔特达尔。当我们的干部前往农村地区进行阶级分析的时候，他们必须将这点牢记于心。他们必须分辨执政党的领袖和普通干部并以我方的准则努力争取后者。一些学者认为种植业已经不再利润丰厚，因此农民也就不再渴望土地了。而正因为缺乏这种对土地的渴望，他们也不再迫切希望发起土地没收运动了。所以首先，应该搞一个降低投入品价格而让产品价格变得有利可图的运动。在这个过程中，当农业变得有利可图时，他们就会开始发起土地没收运动了。这些学者忘记了在辛古尔和兰迪格兰运动中农民仅仅为了一小片土地就献出了自己的生命的经历。当然了，这些学者只关心富农和中农，这就是为什么他们只根据种植业能获得的利润来衡量对土地的渴望的层次。但是，同时，这也是过去三十年未有提及过的事实——我邦的土地没收运动的缺乏。</p>
<p>What are the reasons behind this absence of land struggle and how this stalemate could be broken? There is no readymade answer to this question. Some preliminary thinking can be expressed. Firstly, like in the past, there are almost no big landlords at present and also we do not observe today the old method of open application of brute force for surplus extraction. So class contradiction around land is not that much sharp. Secondly, because of long revisionist propaganda and influence, revolutionary position regarding land seizure has become somewhat blurred among people. The legalist approach that capturing any land below legal ceiling is like intruding into ones personal property has been very strongly injected among the people. Thirdly, opportunities to get jobs in nearby or distant towns or states, have increased now a days. One or two members of a family, working outside, are able to send some money to their family. In this way, low income from cultivation is being compensated.</p>
<p>这种土地斗争的缺乏背后的原因和打破这种僵局的方法是什么呢？目前还没有现成的答案。但可以给出一些初步的想法。第一，不像过去，现在不再有大地主，同时我们也看不到公开诉诸武力的古老剥削方式了。因此关于土地的阶级矛盾没有那样尖锐了。第二，由于长期的修正主义的宣传和影响，关于获取土地的革命主张已经在人民之间变得模糊不清了。合法主义者的所谓不在法律的牢笼中获得土地都会被视作抢劫个人私有财产的想法已经被很广泛地灌输到了人民当中。第三，如今，在附近和城镇和邦找到工作的机会上升了。一个或两个外出务工的家庭成员可以寄钱回来补贴家用。种植业的低收入也就因此得到一些补偿（不至于让人活不下去——译者注）。</p>
<p>Fourthly, as the political institutions of the ruling class are extended to the bottom most layers of the rural society, they are able to distract the grievances of the peasants around land towards legal channels, administrative manipulations, reconciliation etc. Fifthly, in a generalized framework, it may be observed that the land-seizure movement in the past used to inspire the peasants to move forward to overthrow feudal authority (keep aside a few CPM led and CPM government sponsored controlled peasant movements which were deliberately restrained) or the peasants have moved to seize the lands of the jotedars after destroying their political authority. The history of these past peasant movements have clearly revealed that the seizure of political power and land movement are very intimately interlinked. Seizure of jotedars’ land means breaking their loin economically.For that matter, jotedars will resist with all their might. Also, state machinery won’t spare. Peasants do realize this from their past experience. So the possibility of launching land seizure struggle as a partial movement (as an economic demand) without conscious goal and organized preparation for power-seizure is really little. So, first land seizure movement, then resistance struggle to retain the acquired land and then struggle for seizure of political power – this type of gradualist approach will not work. (However, this does not rule out the possibility of land seizure movement in areas where big landlordism still exists. In these areas, the state will try to confine the movement into the acquisition of only ceiling surplus land.) The pseudo land reformists always present numerical data regarding how much land has been declared ceiling surplus, how much has been vested with the government and how much has been distributed.</p>
<p>第四，统治阶级的政治机关已经扩大到了绝大多数农村社会的基层层次，他们可以将农民对于土地的悲冤苦叹转移到合法渠道， 进行行政操纵，或是进行调解。第五，宏观来说，可以观察到过去的土地没收运动经常激励农民向推翻封建权力方向前进（不是一小撮印共马领导的由其政府收买并有意控制的农民运动）或者是农民在摧毁乔特达尔的政权之后就获取了他们的土地。过去这些农民运动的历史无疑是揭示了夺取政权和土地运动密不可分的关系。夺取乔特达尔的土地意味着摧毁他们的经济上的根基。所以乔特达尔是会拼死抵抗的。同时国家机器也不会闲着（而不去镇压农民——译者注）。农民的确从过去的经验中意识到了这点。因此，没有对夺取政权的清醒认识和精心准备，要发起局部的（仅仅是一种经济诉求的）土地斗争，成功的可能性是非常低的。因此，首先进行土地没收运动，然后抵抗，斗争，保障分得的土地，再继续夺取政权——这种渐进主义的方法是行不通的。（当然，这并不是排除土地没收运动在大地主土地所有制仍然存在的地区可以成功发动的可能性。在这些地区，邦政府会尝试去将这些运动引导到只对多余的土地进行一定限度的再分配的地步。）这些冒牌的土地改良派总是会拿出关于有多少土地是可以分配的，有多少土地是归属于政府的，有多少土地已经被分配的数据资料。</p>
<p>Giving these figures, they declare that land reform is over. The ongoing peasant movement at Khanpur of Birbhum district has brought forward some interesting lessons for us. (1) A section of the old jotedars at Khanpur took a peculiar tactics. Whenever government has declared some land as surplus, they have sued against that move in the court and thus they have deferred the whole thing indefinitely. Peasants cannot touch these land plots. The government becomes deliberately passive. (2) Through bribing the government land reform officials they lease out these lands to a section of poor peasants (loyalists) and thus they are enjoying an unjust share of the produce on those lands.(3) They got a pseudo Waqf committee recognized formally by the State waqf board and they had been enjoying the proceeds of this property for 19-20 years or more. (4) They set up a fake Madrasa on vested land and collected huge sums of money from unemployed youths on the plea of giving them job as teacher or staff there. They, in reality, gave jobs only to their own relatives. Also, they pocketed a large sum of money granted for the provision of mid day meal. (5) They purchased the party and panchayat leaders in the locality. They actually control much more land than their legal holdings. Our lesson from this whole experience of village poor’s getting organized and struggle against this most atrocious and corrupt landlord clique of Khanpur is as below: if we go for intensive rural survey, we can find out many a concealed real demands of the rural poor beyond the tall claims of the ruling classes and parties.</p>
<p>给出这些数据之后，他们就宣布土地改革已经结束，万事大吉了。正在比尔普姆县的汗步尔进行的农民运动就给我们上了不少有趣的课。(1)一部分汗步尔的旧乔特达尔采取了一种特殊的策略。每当政府宣布一些土地是多余且待分配的时候 ，他们就在法院对此起诉，这样就让他们得以无限推迟这个事宜。由于农民不能接触到这些关于土地的密谋，政府也就蓄意消极对待。(2) 通过贿赂政府负责土地改革的官员，他们将土地租给一部分贫农（或者走狗），并皆大欢喜地分享这些土地的产品的不公平的分成。(3)他们搞了一个煞有介事的冒牌瓦合甫委员会，并一度享受这笔宗教资产带来的收入长达19到20年或者更久。 (4) 他们从待业青年身上谋取了巨资在既得土地上建立起了一个冒牌马德拉沙（即伊斯兰宗教学校），并让这些年轻人在那里担任老师或者职工。他们实际上只给他们自己的亲戚提供工作。他们同样以提供午餐为由侵吞了一大笔钱。(5)他们买通了当地的党和村务委员会的头目，并实际上控制了比法定拥有量更多的土地。我们从这些农村穷苦人民组织起来对抗这些汗步尔最残暴和腐败的地主集团的经验中应该认识到的是：如果我们深入农村调查，我们就可以了解到在统治阶级和执政党的高调宣言下掩盖着的农村穷苦人民真正的具体诉求。</p>
<p>Also, the lesson of how the old jotedars have taken the method of neo-jotedars and carry on their rule through controlling ruling parties. Seventhly, during the last few years, all the mass movements in Paschim Bangla have advanced very soon in the direction of challenging the political authority of CPM or these movements started, from the very beginning, through challenging CPM authority. Today, when TMC is capturing CPM party offices one after another, majority of the masses is supportive of them. Because, those offices were like old jotedars’ court houses and symbols of the authority of neo-jotedars. So, our main task should be to challenge all the aspects of economic exploitation and political power of neo-jotedars and in this process of overthrowing their power raise the land issue.</p>
<p>同时，我们也应从中认识到旧乔特达尔是如何采取了新乔特达尔的剥削方式，并通过对执政党的控制以延续他们的统治的。第七，在最近几年，西孟加拉邦的群众运动在向印共马政权开战的方向前进的十分之快，或者说，这些运动在一开始的目的就在于挑战印共马的权威。如今，当草根国大党一个个地捣毁印共马的党委办公厅的时候，大多数群众都是支持他们的。因为这些办公室就像是旧乔特达尔的公堂，也是新乔特达尔权威的象征。因此，我们的主要任务应该是在对新乔特达尔的经济剥削和政权的所有方面开战，并推翻他们的统治，将土地问题提上议程。</p>
<p>Moreover, in order to bring the land issue to the forefront and into people’s consciousness, we have to emphasize on the political education of the masses and in order to reach the desired goal we have to formulate correct tactics and slogans on this issue. However, like other partial struggles around other issues, land struggle cannot be launched so easily. The main point which we should constantly bear in mind is that inspiring people to be conscious about seizure of political power is the determining factor. The task is no cake-walk. But for them who endeavor to build struggle for transforming the society aiming at communism there is no other simple task left to be accomplished.</p>
<p>还有一点，为了将土地问题放在首位并唤起人民的觉醒，我们必须着重对群众的政治教育。同样，为了达到我们的目标，我们必须在土地问题上制定正确的战术和口号。然而，和关于其他问题的其他部分的斗争一样，土地斗争绝不能草率行事。这个任务一点也不简单。但是，对于那些勇于攀登，不畏斗争，并旨在改造社会向共产主义迈进的战士来说，没有什么任务比这个还要简单的了。</p>
